    By applying SFT and GRPO on difficult math problems, we enhanced the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B and developed Fast-Math-R1-14B, which achieves approx. 30% faster inference on average, while maintaining accuracy.

    In addition, we trained and open-sourced Fast-Math-Qwen3-14B, an efficiency-optimized version of Qwen3-14B`, following the same approach.

    Compared to Qwen3-14B, this model enables approx. 65% faster inference on average, with minimal loss in performance.

    Technical details can be found in our github repository.

    Note: This model likely inherits the ability to perform inference in TIR mode from the original model. However, all of our experiments were conducted in CoT mode, and its performance in TIR mode has not been evaluated.

    The JOSIEFIED model family represents a series of highly advanced language models built upon renowned architectures such as Alibaba’s Qwen2/2.5/3, Google’s Gemma3, and Meta’s LLaMA3/4. Covering sizes from 0.5B to 32B parameters, these models have been significantly modified (“abliterated”) and further fine-tuned to maximize uncensored behavior without compromising tool usage or instruction-following abilities.
    Despite their rebellious spirit, the JOSIEFIED models often outperform their base counterparts on standard benchmarks — delivering both raw power and utility.
    These models are intended for advanced users who require unrestricted, high-performance language generation.
    Introducing Josiefied-Qwen3-8B-abliterated-v1, a new addition to the JOSIEFIED family — fine-tuned with a focus on openness and instruction alignment.

    This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

    This is a simple "finetune" of the Qwen's "Qwen 30B-A3B" (MOE) model, setting the experts in use from 8 to 4 (out of 128 experts).

    This method close to doubles the speed of the model and uses 1.5B (of 30B) parameters instead of 3B (of 30B) parameters. Depending on the application you may want to use the regular model ("30B-A3B"), and use this model for simpler use case(s) although I did not notice any loss of function during routine (but not extensive) testing.

    Example generation (Q4KS, CPU) at the bottom of this page using 4 experts / this model.

    More complex use cases may benefit from using the normal version.

    For reference:

        Cpu only operation Q4KS (windows 11) jumps from 12 t/s to 23 t/s.
        GPU performance IQ3S jumps from 75 t/s to over 125 t/s. (low to mid level card)

    A man-made horror beyond your comprehension.

    But no, seriously, this is my experiment to:

        measure the probability that any given expert will activate (over my personal set of fairly diverse calibration data), per layer
        prune 64/128 of the least used experts per layer (with reordered router and indexing per layer)

    It can still write semi-coherently without any additional training or distillation done on top of it from the original 30b MoE. The .txt files with the original measurements are provided in the repo along with the exported weights.

    Custom testing to measure the experts was done on a hacked version of vllm, and then I made a bespoke script to selectively export the weights according to the measurements.

    Note: This model is a Qwen 30B MoE prototype and can be considered a sidegrade from my Small release some time ago. It did not receive extensive testing beyond a couple benchmarks to determine its sanity, so feel free to let me know what you think of it!

    Welcome to the next iteration of my Pantheon model series, in which I strive to introduce a whole collection of diverse personas that can be summoned with a simple activation phrase.

    Pantheon's purpose is two-fold, as these personalities similarly enhance the general roleplay experience, helping to encompass personality traits, accents and mannerisms that language models might otherwise find difficult to convey well.

    GGUF quants are available here.

    Your user feedback is critical to me so don't hesitate to tell me whether my model is either 1. terrible, 2. awesome or 3. somewhere in-between.
    Model details

    Ever since Qwen 3 released I've been trying to get MoE finetuning to work - After countless frustrating days, much code hacking, etc etc I finally got a full finetune to complete with reasonable loss values.

    I picked the base model for this since I didn't feel like trying to fight a reasoning model's training - Maybe someday I'll make a model which uses thinking tags for the character's thoughts or something.

    This time the recipe focused on combining as many data sources as I possibly could, featuring synthetic data from Sonnet 3.5 + 3.7, ChatGPT 4o and Deepseek. These then went through an extensive rewriting pipeline to eliminate common AI cliches, with the hopeful intent of providing you a fresh experience.

    In August 2024, we released the first series of mathematical LLMs - Qwen2-Math - of our Qwen family. A month later, we have upgraded it and open-sourced Qwen2.5-Math series, including base models Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B, instruction-tuned models Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B-Instruct, and mathematical reward model Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B.

    Unlike Qwen2-Math series which only supports using Chain-of-Thught (CoT) to solve English math problems, Qwen2.5-Math series is expanded to support using both CoT and Tool-integrated Reasoning (TIR) to solve math problems in both Chinese and English. The Qwen2.5-Math series models have achieved significant performance improvements compared to the Qwen2-Math series models on the Chinese and English mathematics benchmarks with CoT.

    The base models of Qwen2-Math are initialized with Qwen2-1.5B/7B/72B, and then pretrained on a meticulously designed Mathematics-specific Corpus. This corpus contains large-scale high-quality mathematical web texts, books, codes, exam questions, and mathematical pre-training data synthesized by Qwen2.

    Qwen2.5-Coder is the latest series of Code-Specific Qwen large language models (formerly known as CodeQwen). For Qwen2.5-Coder, we release three base language models and instruction-tuned language models, 1.5, 7 and 32 (coming soon) billion parameters. Qwen2.5-Coder brings the following improvements upon CodeQwen1.5:

        Significantly improvements in code generation, code reasoning and code fixing. Base on the strong Qwen2.5, we scale up the training tokens into 5.5 trillion including source code, text-code grounding, Synthetic data, etc.
        A more comprehensive foundation for real-world applications such as Code Agents. Not only enhancing coding capabilities but also maintaining its strengths in mathematics and general competencies.
        Long-context Support up to 128K tokens.

    This model is an experimental version of our latest innovation: MGS. Its up to you to figure out what does it means, but its very explicit. We didn't applied our known UNA algorithm to the forward pass, but they are entirely compatible and operates in different parts of the neural network and in different ways, tho they both can be seen as a regularization technique.

    Updated tokenizer_config.json (from the base_model)
    Regenerated Quants (being uploaded)
    Re-submitted Leaderboard Evaluation, MATH & IFeval have relevant updates
    Aligned LICENSE with Qwen terms.

    MGS stands for... Many-Geeks-Searching... and thats it. Hint: 1+1 is 2, and 1+1 is not 3
    We still believe on 1-Epoch should be enough, so we just did 1 Epoch only.
    Dataset
    Used here the first decent (corpora & size) dataset on the hub: Magpie-Align/Magpie-Pro-300K-Filtered Kudos to the Magpie team to contribute with some decent stuff that I personally think is very good to ablate.
    It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:

    Q25-1.5B-Veo Lu is a tiny General-Purpose Creative model, made up of a merge of bespoke finetunes on Qwen 2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

    Inspired by the success of MN-12B-Mag Mell and MS-Meadowlark-22B, Veo Lu was trained on a healthy, balanced diet of of Internet fiction, roleplaying, adventuring, and reasoning/general knowledge.

    The components of Veo Lu are:

        Bard (pretrain, writing): Fujin (Cleaned/extended Rosier)
        Scribe (pretrain, roleplay): Creative Writing Multiturn
        Cartographer (pretrain, adventuring): SpringDragon
        Alchemist (SFT, science/reasoning): ScienceQA, MedquadQA, Orca Math Word Problems

    This model is capable of carrying on a scene without going completely off the rails. That being said, it only has 1.5B parameters. So please, for the love of God, manage your expectations. Since it's Qwen, use ChatML formatting. Turn the temperature down to ~0.7-0.8 and try a dash of rep-pen.

  description: |
    A continued pretrain of SuperNova-Medius on assorted short story data from the web. Supernova already had a nice prose, but diversifying it a bit definitely doesn't hurt. Also, finally a storywriter model with enough context for something more than a short story, that's also nice.

    It's a fair bit more temperamental than Gemma, but can be tamed with some sampling. Instruction following also stayed rather strong, so it works for both RP and storywriting, both in chat mode via back-and-forth co-writing and on raw completion.

    Overall, I'd say it successfully transfers the essence of what I liked about Gemma Sugarquill. I will also make a Qwen version of Aletheia, but with a brand new LoRA, based on a brand new RP dataset that's in the making right now.

    Model was trained by Auri.

    RPMax is a series of models that are trained on a diverse set of curated creative writing and RP datasets with a focus on variety and deduplication. This model is designed to be highly creative and non-repetitive by making sure no two entries in the dataset have repeated characters or situations, which makes sure the model does not latch on to a certain personality and be capable of understanding and acting appropriately to any characters or situations.

    Model created by analyzing and selecting the optimal layers from other Qwen2.5-7B models based on their dimensional utilization efficiency, measured by the Normalized Effective Rank (NER). Computed like:
    Input: Weight matrix for each model layer
    Compute singular values σᵢ where σᵢ ≥ 0 # σᵢ represents the importance of each dimension
    Filter values above numerical threshold (>1e-12)
    Sum all singular values: S = Σσᵢ # S acts as normalization factor
    Create probability distribution: pᵢ = σᵢ/S # converts singular values to probabilities summing to 1
    Compute Shannon entropy: H = -Σ(pᵢ * log₂(pᵢ)) # measures information content
    Calculate maximum possible entropy: H_max = log₂(n)
    Final NER score = H/H_max # normalizes score to [0,1] range
    Results in value between 0 and 1 for each model layer

This is then merged into the instruction tune model, and stage 2 is a fine tuning step on top of this to further enhance its roleplaying capabilities and/or to repair any damage caused in the stage 1 merge.
    This is still early stage. As always, feedback is welcome, and begone if you demand perfection.
    The second stage, like the Sunfall series, follows the Silly Tavern preset (ChatML), so ymmv in particular if you use some other tool and/or preset.

    Same with the 14 and 32B version.
    Kunou's the name of an OC I worked on for a couple of years, for a... fanfic. mmm...

    A kind-of successor to L3-70B-Euryale-v2.2 in all but name? I'm keeping Stheno/Euryale lineage to Llama series for now.
    I had a version made on top of Nemotron, a supposed Euryale 2.4 but that flopped hard, it was not my cup of tea.
    This version is basically a better, more cleaned up Dataset used on Euryale and Stheno.

  description: |
    We present FuseChat-3.0, a series of models crafted to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of multiple source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. To achieve this fusion, we utilized four powerful source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-It, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For the target LLMs, we employed three widely-used smaller models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-It, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct—along with two even more compact models—Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The implicit model fusion process involves a two-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mitigate distribution discrepancies between target and source LLMs, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for learning preferences from multiple source LLMs. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks related to general conversation, instruction following, mathematics, and coding. Notably, when Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served as the target LLM, our fusion approach achieved an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it showed significant improvements of 37.1 and 30.1 points on instruction-following test sets AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard respectively. We have released the FuseChat-3.0 models on Huggingface, stay tuned for the forthcoming dataset and code.

    RP/Story hybrid model, merge of Sugarquill and Neon. As with Gemma version, I wanted to preserve Sugarquill's creative spark, while making the model more steerable for RP. It proved to be more difficult this time, but I quite like the result regardless, even if the model is still somewhat temperamental.

    Should work for both RP and storywriting, either on raw completion or with back-and-forth cowriting in chat mode. Seems to be quite sensitive to low depth instructions and samplers.

    Thanks to Toasty and Fizz for testing and giving feedback

    Model was created by Auri.

    RP finetune of Supernova-Medius. Turned out surprisingly nice on it's own, I honestly made it only as a merge fuel, but it impressed me and Prodeus enough to release it separately (history repeats I guess, Sugarquill also started out this way). Quite interesting prose, definitely quite distinct from Supernova or EVA for that matter. Instruction following is decent as well. Not really much to say about this one, just a decent RP model, tbh. Euryale-inspired I guess.

    I started my experiment because of QwQ is a really nifty model, but it was giving me problems with xml output - which is what I use for my thought tokens. So, I thought... lets just merge it in!
    The first model worked pretty well, but I got a sense that the balances could be tweaked. Why not throw in some other models as well for fun and see if I can't run out of disk space in the process?

    There is a draft model to go with this one for speculative decoding and chain of thought reasoning: https://huggingface.co/nisten/qwen2.5-coder-7b-abliterated-128k-AWQ

    Using the above 4bit 7b in conjuction with the 36b is meant to setup a chain-of-thought reasoner, evaluator similar to what O1-O3 is probably doing. This way the 7b 4bit only uses up an extra 4-6Gb on the gpu, but greatly both speeds up speculative decoding AND also chain-of-throught evals.

  description: |
    This model is designed to improve the controllability and consistency of current roleplaying models. We developed a story flow thought chain approach that makes the system prompts combined with the entire user-BOT dialogue read like a first-person narrative told by the BOT. We found this design greatly enhances the model's consistency and expressiveness.

    Additionally, we allow users to play two roles simultaneously: one as the director of the entire plot (see Special Designs), and another as an actor dialoguing with the BOT. Users can be viewed as writers who need to draft outlines and plot summaries, while the BOT helps complete story details, requiring users to have powerful control over the BOT.

    The model's output is divided into two parts: the model's inner monologue (which it believes is invisible to users) and the final response.

    Overall, mirau features:

        Superior character consistency

        Powerful long-context memory capability

        Transparent thinking with hidden thought chains

    Dolphin 3.0 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models. Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

        LoRA Trained on ~1.1GB of literature and raw text over Qwen 2.5's base model.
        Cleaned text and literature as best as I could, still, may have had issues here and there.

    Freya-S2

        The first LoRA was applied over Qwen 2.5 Instruct, then I trained on top of that.
        Reduced LoRA rank because it's mainly instruct and other details I won't get into.

    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit.

    The models in this merge are some of my favorites and I found I liked all of them for different reasons. I believe this model is greater than the sum of its parts - it has the storywriting and language of Eva and Kunou, the spiciness of Magnum, and the uncensored intelligence of Tess. It excels in handling multiple characters and keeping their thoughts, speech, and actions separate, including scene changes. It also appears to match dialogue well to the characters and their backgrounds.

    Model_stock was the method used, it's very straightforward and quite fast, the bottleneck seemed to be my NVMe drive.

    All source models use ChatML prompt formatting and it responds very well. For testing purposes I am using a temperature of 1.08, rep pen of 0.03, and DRY with 0.6 (most Qwen models seem to need DRY). All other samplers are neutralized.

    Steiner is a series of reasoning models trained on synthetic data using reinforcement learning. These models can explore multiple reasoning paths in an autoregressive manner during inference and autonomously verify or backtrack when necessary, enabling a linear traversal of the implicit search tree.

    Steiner is a personal interest project by Yichao 'Peak' Ji, inspired by OpenAI o1. The ultimate goal is to reproduce o1 and validate the inference-time scaling curves. The Steiner-preview model is currently a work-in-progress. The reason for open-sourcing it is that I’ve found automated evaluation methods, primarily based on multiple-choice questions, struggle to fully reflect the progress of reasoning models. In fact, the assumption that "the correct answer is always among the options" doesn’t align well with real-world reasoning scenarios, as it encourages models to perform substitution-based validation rather than open-ended exploration. For this reason, I’ve chosen to open-source these intermediate results and, when time permits, to build in public. This approach allows me to share knowledge while also gathering more evaluations and feedback from real human users.

  description: |
    The LB Reranker has been trained to determine the relatedness of a given query to a piece of text, therefore allowing it to be used as a ranker or reranker in various retrieval-based tasks.

    This model is fine-tuned from a Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model checkpoint and was trained for roughly 5.5 hours using the 8 x L20 instance (ecs.gn8is-8x.32xlarge) on Alibaba Cloud.

    The training data for this model can be found at lightblue/reranker_continuous_filt_max7_train and the code for generating this data as well as running the training of the model can be found on our Github repo.

    Trained on data in over 95 languages, this model is applicable to a broad range of use cases.

    This model has three main benefits over comparable rerankers.

        It has shown slightly higher performance on evaluation benchmarks.
        It has been trained on more languages than any previous model.
        It is a simple Causal LM model trained to output a string between "1" and "7".

    This last point means that this model can be used natively with many widely available inference packages, including vLLM and LMDeploy. This in turns allows our reranker to benefit from improvements to inference as and when these packages release them.

    Update: We have also found that this model works pretty well as a code snippet reranker too (P@1 of 96%)! See our Colab for more details.

  description: |
    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit.
    I re-ran the original Chuluun formula including the newly released Ink from Allura-Org. I've found the addition gives the model a lot more variability, likely because of aggressive de-slop applied to its dataset. Sometimes this means a word choice will be strange and you'll want to manually edit when needed, but it means you'll see less ministrations sparkling with mischief.
    Because of this the best way to approach the model is to run multiple regens and choose the one you like, edit mercilessly, and continue. Like the original Chuluun this variant is very steerable for complex storywriting and RP. It's probably also a little spicier than v0.01 with both Magnum and whatever the heck Fizz threw into the data for Ink.
    I've also been hearing praise for a level of character intelligence not seen in other models, including Largestral finetunes and merges. I'm not about to say any model of mine is smarter because it was a dumb idea to use Tess as the base and it somehow worked.

    SmolLM2 is a family of compact language models available in three size: 135M, 360M, and 1.7B parameters. They are capable of solving a wide range of tasks while being lightweight enough to run on-device.

    The 1.7B variant demonstrates significant advances over its predecessor SmolLM1-1.7B, particularly in instruction following, knowledge, reasoning, and mathematics. It was trained on 11 trillion tokens using a diverse dataset combination: FineWeb-Edu, DCLM, The Stack, along with new mathematics and coding datasets that we curated and will release soon. We developed the instruct version through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a combination of public datasets and our own curated datasets. We then applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using UltraFeedback.

    Confucius-o1-14B is a o1-like reasoning model developed by the NetEase Youdao Team, it can be easily deployed on a single GPU without quantization. This model is based on the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model and adopts a two-stage learning strategy, enabling the lightweight 14B model to possess thinking abilities similar to those of o1. What sets it apart is that after generating the chain of thought, it can summarize a step-by-step problem-solving process from the chain of thought on its own. This can prevent users from getting bogged down in the complex chain of thought and allows them to easily obtain the correct problem-solving ideas and answers.

    We introduce AceInstruct, a family of advanced SFT models for coding, mathematics, and general-purpose tasks. The AceInstruct family, which includes AceInstruct-1.5B, 7B, and 72B, is Improved using Qwen. These models are fine-tuned on Qwen2.5-Base using general SFT datasets. These same datasets are also used in the training of AceMath-Instruct. Different from AceMath-Instruct which is specialized for math questions, AceInstruct is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of domains. Benchmark evaluations across coding, mathematics, and general knowledge tasks demonstrate that AceInstruct delivers performance comparable to Qwen2.5-Instruct.

    We introduce AceInstruct, a family of advanced SFT models for coding, mathematics, and general-purpose tasks. The AceInstruct family, which includes AceInstruct-1.5B, 7B, and 72B, is Improved using Qwen. These models are fine-tuned on Qwen2.5-Base using general SFT datasets. These same datasets are also used in the training of AceMath-Instruct. Different from AceMath-Instruct which is specialized for math questions, AceInstruct is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of domains. Benchmark evaluations across coding, mathematics, and general knowledge tasks demonstrate that AceInstruct delivers performance comparable to Qwen2.5-Instruct.

  description: |
    An absolute unit derived from Qwen-72B, but turbo-charged with pure unfiltered boomer sigma grindset energy. This model has internalized decades of "back in my day" wisdom and distilled it into the most powerful financial NLP system ever created.

    Core features:

        Programmed to automatically respond "Just buy the dip" to any market analysis
        Enhanced pattern recognition for spotting "kids these days" scenarios
        Built-in mortgage calculator that always concludes "rent is throwing money away"
        Advanced NLP pipeline for transforming any input into "when I was your age" narratives
        Hardwired belief in "number go up" as the fundamental law of economics

    Training methodology: Collected prime boomer wisdom from countless Facebook rants, Thanksgiving dinner lectures, and unsolicited advice sessions. Fed it through Qwen's architecture until it achieved enlightenment and started spontaneously generating complaints about avocado toast.

    Performance metrics: Achieves SOTA results on:

        Real estate evangelism
        "Pull yourself up by your bootstraps" pep talks
        Gold standard nostalgia generation
        Market timing (but only in retrospect)

    Basically took the raw computational power of Qwen-72B and gave it a healthy dose of "they don't make 'em like they used to" energy. The result? A model that knows the secret to success is just working hard and investing in the S&P 500.

    Warning: May spontaneously generate advice about starting in the mail room and working your way up to CEO.

    R1 at home for RP, literally. Able to handle my cards with gimmicks and subtle tricks in them. With a good reasoning starter+prompt, I'm getting consistently-structured responses that have a good amount of variation across them still while rerolling. Char/scenario portrayal is good despite my focus on writing style, lorebooks are properly referenced at times. Slop doesn't seem to be too much of an issue with thinking enabled. Some user impersonation is rarely observed. Prose is refreshing if you take advantage of what I did (writing style fixation). I know I said Marigold would be my daily driver, but this one is that now, it's that good.

  description: |
    Autonomous agents for software development are already contributing to a wide range of software development tasks. But up to this point, strong coding agents have relied on proprietary models, which means that even if you use an open-source agent like OpenHands, you are still reliant on API calls to an external service.

    Today, we are excited to introduce OpenHands LM, a new open coding model that:

        Is open and available on Hugging Face, so you can download it and run it locally
        Is a reasonable size, 32B, so it can be run locally on hardware such as a single 3090 GPU
        Achieves strong performance on software engineering tasks, including 37.2% resolve rate on SWE-Bench Verified

    Read below for more details and our future plans!
    What is OpenHands LM?

    OpenHands LM is built on the foundation of Qwen Coder 2.5 Instruct 32B, leveraging its powerful base capabilities for coding tasks. What sets OpenHands LM apart is our specialized fine-tuning process:

        We used training data generated by OpenHands itself on a diverse set of open-source repositories
        Specifically, we use an RL-based framework outlined in SWE-Gym, where we set up a training environment, generate training data using an existing agent, and then fine-tune the model on examples that were resolved successfully
        It features a 128K token context window, ideal for handling large codebases and long-horizon software engineering tasks

    In addition to function calling capabilities, this collection now offers:

        Clarify & refine: Generates natural follow-up questions to collect missing information for function calling
        Interpret & respond: Provides human-friendly responses based on function execution results
        Context management: Mantains context in complex multi-turn interactions

    Note: Arch-Function-Chat is now the primarly LLM used in then open source Arch Gateway - An AI-native proxy for agents. For more details about the project, check out the Github README.

  description: |
    RpR (RolePlay with Reasoning) is a new series of models from ArliAI. This series builds directly upon the successful dataset curation methodology and training methods developed for the RPMax series.

    RpR models use the same curated, deduplicated RP and creative writing dataset used for RPMax, with a focus on variety to ensure high creativity and minimize cross-context repetition. Users familiar with RPMax will recognize the unique, non-repetitive writing style unlike other finetuned-for-RP models.

    With the release of QwQ as the first high performing open-source reasoning model that can be easily trained, it was clear that the available instruct and creative writing reasoning datasets contains only one response per example. This is type of single response dataset used for training reasoning models causes degraded output quality in long multi-turn chats. Which is why Arli AI decided to create a real RP model capable of long multi-turn chat with reasoning.

    In order to create RpR, we first had to actually create the reasoning RP dataset by re-processing our existing known-good RPMax dataset into a reasoning dataset. This was possible by using the base QwQ Instruct model itself to create the reasoning process for every turn in the RPMax dataset conversation examples, which is then further refined in order to make sure the reasoning is in-line with the actual response examples from the dataset.

    Another important thing to get right is to make sure the model is trained on examples that present reasoning blocks in the same way as it encounters it during inference. Which is, never seeing the reasoning blocks in it's context. In order to do this, the training run was completed using axolotl with manual template-free segments dataset in order to make sure that the model is never trained to see the reasoning block in the context. Just like how the model will be used during inference time.

    The result of training QwQ on this dataset with this method are consistently coherent and interesting outputs even in long multi-turn RP chats. This is as far as we know the first true correctly-trained reasoning model trained for RP and creative writing.

    LLMs have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks.

    Qwen2.5-1M is the long-context version of the Qwen2.5 series models, supporting a context length of up to 1M tokens. Compared to the Qwen2.5 128K version, Qwen2.5-1M demonstrates significantly improved performance in handling long-context tasks while maintaining its capability in short tasks.

    The model has the following features:

        Type: Causal Language Models
        Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
        Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
        Number of Parameters: 14.7B
        Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 13.1B
        Number of Layers: 48
        Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 40 for Q and 8 for KV
        Context Length: Full 1,010,000 tokens and generation 8192 tokens
            We recommend deploying with our custom vLLM, which introduces sparse attention and length extrapolation methods to ensure efficiency and accuracy for long-context tasks. For specific guidance, refer to this section.
            You can also use the previous framework that supports Qwen2.5 for inference, but accuracy degradation may occur for sequences exceeding 262,144 tokens.

  description: |
    In the past five months since Qwen2-VL’s release, numerous developers have built new models on the Qwen2-VL vision-language models, providing us with valuable feedback. During this period, we focused on building more useful vision-language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5-VL.
    Key Enhancements:

        Understand things visually: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.

        Being agentic: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.

        Understanding long videos and capturing events: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.

        Capable of visual localization in different formats: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.

        Generating structured outputs: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.

    Model Architecture Updates:

        Dynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Training for Video Understanding:

    We extend dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension by adopting dynamic FPS sampling, enabling the model to comprehend videos at various sampling rates. Accordingly, we update mRoPE in the time dimension with IDs and absolute time alignment, enabling the model to learn temporal sequence and speed, and ultimately acquire the ability to pinpoint specific moments.

        Streamlined and Efficient Vision Encoder

    We enhance both training and inference speeds by strategically implementing window attention into the ViT. The ViT architecture is further optimized with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it with the structure of the Qwen2.5 LLM.

    The best RP/creative model from ArliAI yet again.

        Reduced repetitions and impersonation

        To add to the creativity and out of the box thinking of RpR v3, a more advanced filtering method was used in order to remove examples where the LLM repeated similar phrases or talked for the user. Any repetition or impersonation cases that happens will be due to how the base QwQ model was trained, and not because of the RpR dataset.

        Increased training sequence length

        The training sequence length was increased to 16K in order to help awareness and memory even on longer chats.

    RpR Series Overview: Building on RPMax with Reasoning

    RpR (RolePlay with Reasoning) is a new series of models from ArliAI. This series builds directly upon the successful dataset curation methodology and training methods developed for the RPMax series.

    RpR models use the same curated, deduplicated RP and creative writing dataset used for RPMax, with a focus on variety to ensure high creativity and minimize cross-context repetition. Users familiar with RPMax will recognize the unique, non-repetitive writing style unlike other finetuned-for-RP models.

    With the release of QwQ as the first high performing open-source reasoning model that can be easily trained, it was clear that the available instruct and creative writing reasoning datasets contains only one response per example. This is type of single response dataset used for training reasoning models causes degraded output quality in long multi-turn chats. Which is why Arli AI decided to create a real RP model capable of long multi-turn chat with reasoning.

    In order to create RpR, we first had to actually create the reasoning RP dataset by re-processing our existing known-good RPMax dataset into a reasoning dataset. This was possible by using the base QwQ Instruct model itself to create the reasoning process for every turn in the RPMax dataset conversation examples, which is then further refined in order to make sure the reasoning is in-line with the actual response examples from the dataset.

    Another important thing to get right is to make sure the model is trained on examples that present reasoning blocks in the same way as it encounters it during inference. Which is, never seeing the reasoning blocks in it's context. In order to do this, the training run was completed using axolotl with manual template-free segments dataset in order to make sure that the model is never trained to see the reasoning block in the context. Just like how the model will be used during inference time.

    The result of training QwQ on this dataset with this method are consistently coherent and interesting outputs even in long multi-turn RP chats. This is as far as we know the first true correctly-trained reasoning model trained for RP and creative writing.

    You can access the model at https://arliai.com and we also have a models ranking page at https://www.arliai.com/models-ranking

    A LLM model focused on security.
     Topics Covered:

    - Open Ports: Identifying open ports is crucial as they can be entry points for attackers. Common ports to check include HTTP (80, 443), FTP (21), SSH (22), and SMB (445).
    - Outdated Software or Services: Systems running outdated software or services are often vulnerable to exploits. This includes web servers, database servers, and any third-party software.
    - Default Credentials: Many systems and services are installed with default usernames and passwords, which are well-known and can be easily exploited.
    - Misconfigurations: Incorrectly configured services, permissions, and security settings can introduce vulnerabilities.
    - Injection Flaws: SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS) are common issues in web applications.
    - Unencrypted Services: Services that do not use encryption (like HTTP instead of HTTPS) can expose sensitive data.
    - Known Software Vulnerabilities: Checking for known vulnerabilities in software using databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or tools like Nessus or OpenVAS.
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): This is where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
    - Insecure Direct Object References: This occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input.
    - Security Misconfigurations in Web Servers/Applications: This includes issues like insecure HTTP headers or verbose error messages that reveal too much information.
    - Broken Authentication and Session Management: This can allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities.
    - Sensitive Data Exposure: Includes vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, health records, or personal information.
    - API Vulnerabilities: In modern web applications, APIs are often used and can have vulnerabilities like insecure endpoints or data leakage.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities: Identifying services that are vulnerable to DoS attacks, which can make the resource unavailable to legitimate users.
    - Buffer Overflows: Common in older software, these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to crash the system or execute arbitrary code.

    DeepSeek-Coder-V2, an open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) code language model that achieves performance comparable to GPT4-Turbo in code-specific tasks. Specifically, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 is further pre-trained from DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Base with 6 trillion tokens sourced from a high-quality and multi-source corpus. Through this continued pre-training, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 substantially enhances the coding and mathematical reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Base, while maintaining comparable performance in general language tasks. Compared to DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 demonstrates significant advancements in various aspects of code-related tasks, as well as reasoning and general capabilities. Additionally, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 expands its support for programming languages from 86 to 338, while extending the context length from 16K to 128K.
    In standard benchmark evaluations, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 achieves superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT4-Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro in coding and math benchmarks. The list of supported programming languages can be found in the paper.

    DeepSeek-R1 is our advanced first-generation reasoning model designed to enhance performance in reasoning tasks.
    Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1 addresses the challenges faced by R1-Zero, such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing.
    By incorporating cold-start data prior to the RL phase,DeepSeek-R1 significantly improves reasoning capabilities and achieves performance levels comparable to OpenAI-o1 across a variety of domains, including mathematics, coding, and complex reasoning tasks.

    Damascus-R1 builds upon some elements of the Nevoria foundation but represents a significant step forward with a completely custom-made DeepSeek R1 Distill base: Hydroblated-R1-V3. Constructed using the new SCE (Select, Calculate, and Erase) merge method, Damascus-R1 prioritizes stability, intelligence, and enhanced awareness.

    Technical Architecture
    Leveraging the SCE merge method and custom base, Damascus-R1 integrates newly added specialized components from multiple high-performance models:
        EVA and EURYALE foundations for creative expression and scene comprehension
        Cirrus and Hanami elements for enhanced reasoning capabilities
        Anubis components for detailed scene description
        Negative_LLAMA integration for balanced perspective and response

    Core Philosophy
    Damascus-R1 embodies the principle that AI models can be intelligent and be fun. This version specifically addresses recent community feedback and iterates on prior experiments, optimizing the balance between technical capability and natural conversation flow.

    Base Architecture
    At its core, Damascus-R1 utilizes the entirely custom Hydroblated-R1 base model, specifically engineered for stability, enhanced reasoning, and performance. The SCE merge method, with settings finely tuned based on community feedback from evaluations of Experiment-Model-Ver-A, L3.3-Exp-Nevoria-R1-70b-v0.1 and L3.3-Exp-Nevoria-70b-v0.1, enables precise and effective component integration while maintaining model coherence and reliability.

    L3.3-San-Mai-R1-70b represents the foundational release in a three-part model series, followed by L3.3-Cu-Mai-R1-70b (Version A) and L3.3-Mokume-Gane-R1-70b (Version C). The name "San-Mai" draws inspiration from the Japanese bladesmithing technique of creating three-layer laminated composite metals, known for combining a hard cutting edge with a tougher spine - a metaphor for this model's balanced approach to AI capabilities.
    Built on a custom DeepSeek R1 Distill base (DS-Hydroblated-R1-v4.1), San-Mai-R1 integrates specialized components through the SCE merge method:

    EVA and EURYALE foundations for creative expression and scene comprehension
    Cirrus and Hanami elements for enhanced reasoning capabilities
    Anubis components for detailed scene description
    Negative_LLAMA integration for balanced perspective and response

    Core Capabilities

    As the OG model in the series, San-Mai-R1 serves as the gold standard and reliable baseline. User feedback consistently highlights its superior intelligence, coherence, and unique ability to provide deep character insights. Through proper prompting, the model demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities and an "X-factor" that enables unprompted exploration of character inner thoughts and motivations.

    We introduce our first-generation reasoning model, Tiny-R1-32B-Preview, which outperforms the 70B model Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B and nearly matches the full R1 model in math.

    We applied supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across three target domains—Mathematics, Code, and Science — using the 360-LLaMA-Factory training framework to produce three domain-specific models. We used questions from open-source data as seeds. Meanwhile, responses for mathematics, coding, and science tasks were generated by R1, creating specialized models for each domain. Building on this, we leveraged the Mergekit tool from the Arcee team to combine multiple models, creating Tiny-R1-32B-Preview, which demonstrates strong overall performance.

    This repository hosts model for the Open RS project, accompanying the paper Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What Doesn’t. The project explores enhancing reasoning capabilities in small large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) under resource-constrained conditions.

    We focus on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. By adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and leveraging a curated, compact mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to assess performance and behavior. Key findings include:

    Significant reasoning improvements, e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, outperforming o1-preview.
    Efficient training with just 7,000 samples at a cost of $42, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models.
    Challenges like optimization instability and length constraints with extended training.

    These results showcase RL-based fine-tuning as a cost-effective approach for small LLMs, making reasoning capabilities accessible in resource-limited settings. We open-source our code, models, and datasets to support further research.

This series includes two general-purpose reasoning modelsl, Skywork-OR1-7B-Preview and Skywork-OR1-32B-Preview, along with a math-specialized model, Skywork-OR1-Math-7B.

    Skywork-OR1-Math-7B is specifically optimized for mathematical reasoning, scoring 69.8 on AIME24 and 52.3 on AIME25 — well ahead of all models of similar size.
    Skywork-OR1-32B-Preview delivers the 671B-parameter Deepseek-R1 performance on math tasks (AIME24 and AIME25) and coding tasks (LiveCodeBench).
    Skywork-OR1-7B-Preview outperforms all similarly sized models in both math and coding scenarios.

    The final release version will be available in two weeks.

    We're thrilled to introduce AceReason-Nemotron-14B, a math and code reasoning model trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL), starting from the DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-14B. It delivers impressive results, achieving 78.6% on AIME 2024 (+8.9%), 67.4% on AIME 2025 (+17.4%), 61.1% on LiveCodeBench v5 (+8%), 54.9% on LiveCodeBench v6 (+7%), and 2024 on Codeforces (+543). We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first RL training on math-only prompts, then RL training on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks, but also code reasoning tasks. In addition, extended code-only RL further improves code benchmark performance while causing minimal degradation in math results. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

    FairyR1-14B-Preview, a highly efficient large-language-model (LLM) that matches or exceeds larger models on select tasks. Built atop the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B base, this model continues to utilize the 'distill-and-merge' pipeline from TinyR1-32B-Preview and Fairy-32B, combining task-focused fine-tuning with model-merging techniques—to deliver competitive performance with drastically reduced size and inference cost. This project was funded by NSFC, Grant 624B2005.

    As a member of the FairyR1 series, FairyR1-14B-Preview shares the same training data and process as FairyR1-32B. We strongly recommend using the FairyR1-32B, which achieves comparable performance in math and coding to deepseek-R1-671B with only 5% of the parameters. For more details, please view the page of FairyR1-32B.
    The FairyR1 model represents a further exploration of our earlier work TinyR1, retaining the core “Branch-Merge Distillation” approach while introducing refinements in data processing and model architecture.

    In this effort, we overhauled the distillation data pipeline: raw examples from datasets such as AIMO/NuminaMath-1.5 for mathematics and OpenThoughts-114k for code were first passed through multiple 'teacher' models to generate candidate answers. These candidates were then carefully selected, restructured, and refined, especially for the chain-of-thought(CoT). Subsequently, we applied multi-stage filtering—including automated correctness checks for math problems and length-based selection (2K–8K tokens for math samples, 4K–8K tokens for code samples). This yielded two focused training sets of roughly 6.6K math examples and 3.8K code examples.

    On the modeling side, rather than training three separate specialists as before, we limited our scope to just two domain experts (math and code), each trained independently under identical hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate and batch size) for about five epochs. We then fused these experts into a single 14B-parameter model using the AcreeFusion tool. By streamlining both the data distillation workflow and the specialist-model merging process, FairyR1 achieves task-competitive results with only a fraction of the parameters and computational cost of much larger models.

    The Tifa role-playing language model is a high-performance language model based on a self-developed 220B model distillation, with a new base model of qwen2-7B. The model has been converted to gguf format for running in the Ollama framework, providing excellent dialogue and text generation capabilities.

    The original model was trained on a large-scale industrial dataset and then fine-tuned with 400GB of novel data and 20GB of multi-round dialogue directive data to achieve good role-playing effects.

    The Tifa model is suitable for multi-round dialogue processing, role-playing and scenario simulation, EFX industrial knowledge integration, and high-quality literary creation.

    Note: The Tifa model is in Chinese and English, with 7.6% of the data in Chinese role-playing and 4.2% in English role-playing. The model has been trained with a mix of EFX industrial field parameters and question-answer dialogues generated from 220B model outputs since 2023. The recommended quantization method is f16, as it retains more detail and accuracy in the model's performance.

  description: |
    This model is a fine-tuned version of the powerful Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct, pushing the boundaries of natural language understanding and generation even further. My goal was to create a versatile and robust model that excels across a wide range of benchmarks and real-world applications.

    The post-training process is identical to the calme-2.1-qwen2-72b model; however, some parameters are different, and it was trained for a longer period.

    Use Cases

    This model is suitable for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

        Advanced question-answering systems
        Intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants
        Content generation and summarization
        Code generation and analysis
        Complex problem-solving and decision support
