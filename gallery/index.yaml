    By applying SFT and GRPO on difficult math problems, we enhanced the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B and developed Fast-Math-R1-14B, which achieves approx. 30% faster inference on average, while maintaining accuracy.

    In addition, we trained and open-sourced Fast-Math-Qwen3-14B, an efficiency-optimized version of Qwen3-14B`, following the same approach.

    Compared to Qwen3-14B, this model enables approx. 65% faster inference on average, with minimal loss in performance.

    Technical details can be found in our github repository.

    Note: This model likely inherits the ability to perform inference in TIR mode from the original model. However, all of our experiments were conducted in CoT mode, and its performance in TIR mode has not been evaluated.

    The JOSIEFIED model family represents a series of highly advanced language models built upon renowned architectures such as Alibaba’s Qwen2/2.5/3, Google’s Gemma3, and Meta’s LLaMA3/4. Covering sizes from 0.5B to 32B parameters, these models have been significantly modified (“abliterated”) and further fine-tuned to maximize uncensored behavior without compromising tool usage or instruction-following abilities.
    Despite their rebellious spirit, the JOSIEFIED models often outperform their base counterparts on standard benchmarks — delivering both raw power and utility.
    These models are intended for advanced users who require unrestricted, high-performance language generation.
    Introducing Josiefied-Qwen3-8B-abliterated-v1, a new addition to the JOSIEFIED family — fine-tuned with a focus on openness and instruction alignment.

    This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

    This is a simple "finetune" of the Qwen's "Qwen 30B-A3B" (MOE) model, setting the experts in use from 8 to 4 (out of 128 experts).

    This method close to doubles the speed of the model and uses 1.5B (of 30B) parameters instead of 3B (of 30B) parameters. Depending on the application you may want to use the regular model ("30B-A3B"), and use this model for simpler use case(s) although I did not notice any loss of function during routine (but not extensive) testing.

    Example generation (Q4KS, CPU) at the bottom of this page using 4 experts / this model.

    More complex use cases may benefit from using the normal version.

    For reference:

        Cpu only operation Q4KS (windows 11) jumps from 12 t/s to 23 t/s.
        GPU performance IQ3S jumps from 75 t/s to over 125 t/s. (low to mid level card)

    A man-made horror beyond your comprehension.

    But no, seriously, this is my experiment to:

        measure the probability that any given expert will activate (over my personal set of fairly diverse calibration data), per layer
        prune 64/128 of the least used experts per layer (with reordered router and indexing per layer)

    It can still write semi-coherently without any additional training or distillation done on top of it from the original 30b MoE. The .txt files with the original measurements are provided in the repo along with the exported weights.

    Custom testing to measure the experts was done on a hacked version of vllm, and then I made a bespoke script to selectively export the weights according to the measurements.

    This is an uncensored version of Qwen/Qwen3-14B created with abliteration (see remove-refusals-with-transformers to know more about it). This is a crude, proof-of-concept implementation to remove refusals from an LLM model without using TransformerLens.

    Ablation was performed using a new and faster method, which yields better results.

    Note: This model is a Qwen 30B MoE prototype and can be considered a sidegrade from my Small release some time ago. It did not receive extensive testing beyond a couple benchmarks to determine its sanity, so feel free to let me know what you think of it!

    Welcome to the next iteration of my Pantheon model series, in which I strive to introduce a whole collection of diverse personas that can be summoned with a simple activation phrase.

    Pantheon's purpose is two-fold, as these personalities similarly enhance the general roleplay experience, helping to encompass personality traits, accents and mannerisms that language models might otherwise find difficult to convey well.

    GGUF quants are available here.

    Your user feedback is critical to me so don't hesitate to tell me whether my model is either 1. terrible, 2. awesome or 3. somewhere in-between.
    Model details

    Ever since Qwen 3 released I've been trying to get MoE finetuning to work - After countless frustrating days, much code hacking, etc etc I finally got a full finetune to complete with reasonable loss values.

    I picked the base model for this since I didn't feel like trying to fight a reasoning model's training - Maybe someday I'll make a model which uses thinking tags for the character's thoughts or something.

    This time the recipe focused on combining as many data sources as I possibly could, featuring synthetic data from Sonnet 3.5 + 3.7, ChatGPT 4o and Deepseek. These then went through an extensive rewriting pipeline to eliminate common AI cliches, with the hopeful intent of providing you a fresh experience.

    google/gemma-3-12b-it is an open-source, state-of-the-art, lightweight, multimodal model built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. It is capable of handling text and image input and generating text output. It has a large context window of 128K tokens and supports over 140 languages. The 12B variant has been fine-tuned using the instruction-tuning approach. Gemma 3 models are suitable for a variety of text generation and image understanding tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes them deployable in environments with limited resources such as laptops, desktops, or your own cloud infrastructure.

    Fallen Gemma3 27B v1 is an evil tune of Gemma 3 27B but it is not a complete decensor.

    Evil tunes knock out the positivity and may enjoy torturing you and humanity.

    Vision still works and it has something to say about the crap you feed it.

    This is a pre-alpha proof-of-concept of a real fully uncensored vision model.

    Why do I say "real"? The few vision models we got (qwen, llama 3.2) were "censored," and their fine-tunes were made only to the text portion of the model, as training a vision model is a serious pain.

    The only actually trained and uncensored vision model I am aware of is ToriiGate; the rest of the vision models are just the stock vision + a fine-tuned LLM.

    A creative writing model based on a merge of fine-tunes on Gemma 3 12B IT and Gemma 3 12B PT.

    This is the Story Focused merge. This version works better for storytelling and scenarios, as the prose is more novel-like and it has a tendency to impersonate the user character.

    See the Alternate RP Focused version as well.

    This is a merge of two G3 models, one trained on instruct and one trained on base:

        allura-org/Gemma-3-Glitter-12B - Itself a merge of a storywriting and RP train (both also by ToastyPigeon), on instruct
        ToastyPigeon/Gemma-3-Confetti-12B - Experimental application of the Glitter data using base instead of instruct, additionally includes some adventure data in the form of SpringDragon.

    The result is a lovely blend of Glitter's ability to follow instructions and Confetti's free-spirit prose, effectively 'loosening up' much of the hesitancy that was left in Glitter.

    This is a requantized version of https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-q4_0-gguf. The official QAT weights released by google use fp16 (instead of Q6_K) for the embeddings table, which makes this model take a significant extra amount of memory (and storage) compared to what Q4_0 quants are supposed to take. Requantizing with llama.cpp achieves a very similar result. Note that this model ends up smaller than the Q4_0 from Bartowski. This is because llama.cpp sets some tensors to Q4_1 when quantizing models to Q4_0 with imatrix, but this is a static quant. The perplexity score for this one is even lower with this model compared to the original model by Google, but the results are within margin of error, so it's probably just luck. I also fixed the control token metadata, which was slightly degrading the performance of the model in instruct mode.

    This is a merge of pre-trained gemma3 language models
    Goal of this merge was to create good uncensored gemma 3 model good for assistant and roleplay, with uncensored vision.
    First, vision: i dont know is it normal, but it slightly hallucinate (maybe q3 is too low?), but lack any refusals and otherwise work fine. I used default gemma 3 27b mmproj.
    Second, text: it is slow on my hardware, slower than 24b mistral, speed close to 32b QWQ. Model is smart even on q3, responses are adequate in length and are interesting to read. Model is quite attentive to context, tested up to 8k - no problems or degradation spotted. (beware of your typos, it will copy yours mistakes) Creative capabilities are good too, model will create good plot for you, if you let it. Model follows instructions fine, it is really good in "adventure" type of cards. Russian is supported, is not too great, maybe on higher quants is better. Refusals was not encountered.
    However, i find this model not unbiased enough. It is close to neutrality, but i want it more "dark". Positivity highly depends on prompts. With good enough cards model can do wonders.
    Tested on Q3_K_L, t 1.04.

    This model is an experiment to try to produce a strong smaller thinking model capable of fitting in an 8GiB consumer graphics card with generalizeable reasoning capabilities. Most other open source thinking models, especially on the smaller side, fail to generalize their reasoning to tasks other than coding or math due to an overly large focus on GRPO zero for CoT which is only applicable for coding and math.

    Instead of using GRPO, this model aims to SFT a wide variety of high quality, diverse reasoning traces from Deepseek R1 onto Gemma 3 to force the model to learn to effectively generalize its reasoning capabilites to a large number of tasks as an extension of the LiMO paper's approach to Math/Coding CoT. A subset of V3 O3/24 non-thinking data was also included for improved creativity and to allow the model to retain it's non-thinking capabilites.

    Training off the QAT checkpoint allows for this model to be used without a drop in quality at Q4_0, requiring only ~6GiB of memory.
    Thinking Mode

    Similar to the Qwen 3 model line, Gemma Fornax can be used with or without thinking mode enabled.

        To enable thinking place /think in the system prompt and prefill <think>\n for thinking mode.

        To disable thinking put /no_think in the system prompt.

    MedGemma is a collection of Gemma 3 variants that are trained for performance on medical text and image comprehension. Developers can use MedGemma to accelerate building healthcare-based AI applications. MedGemma currently comes in two variants: a 4B multimodal version and a 27B text-only version.

    MedGemma 4B utilizes a SigLIP image encoder that has been specifically pre-trained on a variety of de-identified medical data, including chest X-rays, dermatology images, ophthalmology images, and histopathology slides. Its LLM component is trained on a diverse set of medical data, including radiology images, histopathology patches, ophthalmology images, and dermatology images.

    MedGemma 4B is available in both pre-trained (suffix: -pt) and instruction-tuned (suffix -it) versions. The instruction-tuned version is a better starting point for most applications. The pre-trained version is available for those who want to experiment more deeply with the models.

    MedGemma 27B has been trained exclusively on medical text and optimized for inference-time computation. MedGemma 27B is only available as an instruction-tuned model.

    MedGemma variants have been evaluated on a range of clinically relevant benchmarks to illustrate their baseline performance. These include both open benchmark datasets and curated datasets. Developers can fine-tune MedGemma variants for improved performance. Consult the Intended Use section below for more details.

    - The BEST Phi-4 Roleplay finetune in the world (Not that much of an achievement here, Phi roleplay  finetunes can probably be counted on a single hand).
    - Compact size & fully healed from the brain surgery Only 11.9B parameters. Phi-4 wasn't that hard to run even at 14B, now with even fewer brain cells, your new phone could probably run it easily. (SD8Gen3 and above recommended).
    - Strong Roleplay & Creative writing abilities. This really surprised me. Actually good.
    Writes and roleplays quite uniquely, probably because of lack of RP\writing slop in the pretrain. Who would have thought?
    - Smart assistant with low refusals - It kept some of the smarts, and our little Phi-Lthy here will be quite eager to answer your naughty questions.
    - Quite good at following the character card. Finally, it puts its math brain to some productive tasks. Gooner technology is becoming more popular by the day.

    Excellent Roleplay with more brains. (Who would have thought Phi-4 models would be good at this? so weird... )
    Medium length response (1-4 paragraphs, usually 2-3).
    Excellent assistant that follows instructions well enough, and keeps good formating.
    Strong Creative writing abilities. Will obey requests regarding formatting (markdown headlines for paragraphs, etc).
    Writes and roleplays quite uniquely, probably because of lack of RP\writing slop in the pretrain. This is just my guesstimate.
    LOW refusals - Total freedom in RP, can do things other RP models won't, and I'll leave it at that. Low refusals in assistant tasks as well.
    VERY good at following the character card. Math brain is used for gooner tech, as it should be.

    Phi-4-mini-reasoning is a lightweight open model built upon synthetic data with a focus on high-quality, reasoning dense data further finetuned for more advanced math reasoning capabilities. The model belongs to the Phi-4 model family and supports 128K token context length.
    Phi-4-mini-reasoning is designed for multi-step, logic-intensive mathematical problem-solving tasks under memory/compute constrained environments and latency bound scenarios. Some of the use cases include formal proof generation, symbolic computation, advanced word problems, and a wide range of mathematical reasoning scenarios. These models excel at maintaining context across steps, applying structured logic, and delivering accurate, reliable solutions in domains that require deep analytical thinking.
    This model is designed and tested for math reasoning only. It is not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models, as well as performance difference across languages, as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including but not limited to privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case.
    Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.
    This release of Phi-4-mini-reasoning addresses user feedback and market demand for a compact reasoning model. It is a compact transformer-based language model optimized for mathematical reasoning, built to deliver high-quality, step-by-step problem solving in environments where computing or latency is constrained. The model is fine-tuned with synthetic math data from a more capable model (much larger, smarter, more accurate, and better at following instructions), which has resulted in enhanced reasoning performance. Phi-4-mini-reasoning balances reasoning ability with efficiency, making it potentially suitable for educational applications, embedded tutoring, and lightweight deployment on edge or mobile systems. If a critical issue is identified with Phi-4-mini-reasoning, it should be promptly reported through the MSRC Researcher Portal or secure@microsoft.com

    Maestro-10B is a 10 billion parameter model fine-tuned from Virtuoso-Lite, a next-generation language model developed by arcee-ai. Virtuoso-Lite itself is based on the Llama-3 architecture, distilled from Deepseek-v3 using approximately 1.1 billion tokens/logits. This distillation process allows Virtuoso-Lite to achieve robust performance with a smaller parameter count, excelling in reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem-solving. Maestro-10B inherits these strengths from its base model, Virtuoso-Lite, and further enhances them through fine-tuning on the OpenOrca dataset. This combination of a distilled base model and targeted fine-tuning makes Maestro-10B a powerful and efficient language model.

    INTELLECT-1 is the first collaboratively trained 10 billion parameter language model trained from scratch on 1 trillion tokens of English text and code.
    This is an instruct model. The base model associated with it is INTELLECT-1.
    INTELLECT-1 was trained on up to 14 concurrent nodes distributed across 3 continents, with contributions from 30 independent community contributors providing compute. The training code utilizes the prime framework, a scalable distributed training framework designed for fault-tolerant, dynamically scaling, high-perfomance training on unreliable, globally distributed workers. The key abstraction that allows dynamic scaling is the ElasticDeviceMesh which manages dynamic global process groups for fault-tolerant communication across the internet and local process groups for communication within a node. The model was trained using the DiLoCo algorithms with 100 inner steps. The global all-reduce was done with custom int8 all-reduce kernels to reduce the communication payload required, greatly reducing the communication overhead by a factor 400x.

    It's a very balanced model between the L3.3 tunes. It's very creative, able to come up with new and interesting scenarios on your own that will thoroughly surprise you in ways that remind me of a 123B model. It has some of the most natural sounding dialogue and prose can come out of any model I've tried with the right swipe, in a way that truly brings your characters and RP to life that makes you feel like you're talking to a human writer instead of an AI - a quality that reminds me of Character AI in its prime. This model loves a great prompt and thrives off instructions.

    This model was created as I liked the storytelling of EVA, the prose and details of scenes from EURYALE and Anubis, enhanced with Negative_LLAMA to kill off the positive bias with a touch of nemotron sprinkeled in.

    The choice to use the lorablated model as a base was intentional - while it might seem counterintuitive, this approach creates unique interactions between the weights, similar to what was achieved in the original Astoria model and Astoria V2 model . Rather than simply removing refusals, this "weight twisting" effect that occurs when subtracting the lorablated base model from the other models during the merge process creates an interesting balance in the final model's behavior. While this approach differs from traditional sequential application of components, it was chosen for its unique characteristics in the model's responses.

    The Magnum v4 series is complete, but here's something a little extra I wanted to tack on as I wasn't entirely satisfied with the results of v4 72B. "SE" for Special Edition - this model is finetuned from meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct as an rsLoRA adapter. The dataset is a slightly revised variant of the v4 data with some elements of the v2 data re-introduced.

    The objective, as with the other Magnum models, is to emulate the prose style and quality of the Claude 3 Sonnet/Opus series of models on a local scale, so don't be surprised to see "Claude-isms" in its output.

    A merge of some Llama 3.3 models because um uh yeah

    Went extra schizo on the recipe, hoping for an extra fun result, and... Well, I guess it's an overall improvement over the previous revision. It's a tiny bit smarter, has even more distinct swipes and nice dialogues, but for some reason it's damn sloppy.

    I've published the second step of this merge as a separate model, and I'd say the results are more interesting, but not as usable as this one. https://huggingface.co/Nohobby/AbominationSnowPig

  description: |
    This model builds upon the original Nevoria foundation, incorporating the Deepseek-R1 reasoning architecture to enhance dialogue interaction and scene comprehension. While maintaining Nevoria's core strengths in storytelling and scene description (derived from EVA, EURYALE, and Anubis), this iteration aims to improve prompt adherence and creative reasoning capabilities. The model also retains the balanced perspective introduced by Negative_LLAMA and Nemotron elements. Also, the model plays the card to almost a fault, It'll pick up on minor issues and attempt to run with them. Users had it call them out for misspelling a word while playing in character.

    Note: While Nevoria-R1 represents a significant architectural change, rather than a direct successor to Nevoria, it operates as a distinct model with its own characteristics.

    The lorablated model base choice was intentional, creating unique weight interactions similar to the original Astoria model and Astoria V2 model. This "weight twisting" effect, achieved by subtracting the lorablated base model during merging, creates an interesting balance in the model's behavior. While unconventional compared to sequential component application, this approach was chosen for its unique response characteristics.

    Cu-Mai, a play on San-Mai for Copper-Steel Damascus, represents a significant evolution in the three-part model series alongside San-Mai (OG) and Mokume-Gane. While maintaining the grounded and reliable nature of San-Mai, Cu-Mai introduces its own distinct "flavor" in terms of prose and overall vibe. The model demonstrates strong adherence to prompts while offering a unique creative expression.
    L3.3-Cu-Mai-R1-70b integrates specialized components through the SCE merge method:

    EVA and EURYALE foundations for creative expression and scene comprehension
    Cirrus and Hanami elements for enhanced reasoning capabilities
    Anubis components for detailed scene description
    Negative_LLAMA integration for balanced perspective and response

    Users consistently praise Cu-Mai for its:

        Exceptional prose quality and natural dialogue flow
        Strong adherence to prompts and creative expression
        Improved coherency and reduced repetition
        Performance on par with the original model

    While some users note slightly reduced intelligence compared to the original, this trade-off is generally viewed as minimal and doesn't significantly impact the overall experience. The model's reasoning capabilities can be effectively activated through proper prompting techniques.

    After banging my head against the wall some more - I actually managed to merge DeepSeek distill into my mess! Along with even more models (my hand just slipped, I swear)

    The prose is better than in v0.5, but has a different feel to it, so I guess it's more of a step to the side than forward (hence the title EXTRA instead of 0.6).

    The context recall may have improved, or I'm just gaslighting myself to think so.

    And of course, since it now has DeepSeek in it - <think> tags!

    They kinda work out of the box if you add <think> to the 'Start Reply With' field in ST - that way the model will write a really short character thought in it. However, if we want some OOC reasoning, things get trickier.

    My initial thought was that this model could be instructed to use <think> either only for {{char}}'s inner monologue or for detached analysis, but actually it would end up writing character thoughts most of the time anyway, and the times when it did reason stuff it threw the narrative out of the window by making it too formal and even adding some notes at the end.

    We’ve heard over and over from AI Dungeon players that modern AI models are too nice, never letting them fail or die. While it may be good for a chatbot to be nice and helpful, great stories and games aren’t all rainbows and unicorns. They have conflict, tension, and even death. These create real stakes and consequences for characters and the journeys they go on.

    Similarly, great games need opposition. You must be able to fail, die, and may even have to start over. This makes games more fun!

    However, the vast majority of AI models, through alignment RLHF, have been trained away from darkness, violence, or conflict, preventing them from fulfilling this role. To give our players better options, we decided to train our own model to fix these issues.

    The Wayfarer model series are a set of adventure role-play models specifically trained to give players a challenging and dangerous experience.

    We wanted to contribute back to the open source community that we’ve benefitted so much from so we open sourced a 12b parameter version version back in Jan. We thought people would love it but people were even more excited than we expected.

    Due to popular request we decided to train a larger 70b version based on Llama 3.3.

    New merge. This an experiment to increase the "Madness" in a model. Merge is based on top UGI-Bench models (So yeah, I would think this would be benchmaxxing.)

    This is the second time I'm using SCE. The previous MagicalGirl model seems to be quite happy with it.

    Added KaraKaraWitch/Llama-MiraiFanfare-3.3-70B based on feedback I got from others (People generally seem to remember this rather than other models). So I'm not sure how this would play into the merge.
    The following models were included in the merge:

    L3.3-Electra-R1-70b is the newest release of the Unnamed series, this is the 6th iteration based of user feedback.
    Built on a custom DeepSeek R1 Distill base (TheSkullery/L3.1x3.3-Hydroblated-R1-70B-v4.4), Electra-R1 integrates specialized components through the SCE merge method. The model uses float32 dtype during processing with a bfloat16 output dtype for optimized performance.
    Electra-R1 serves newest gold standard and baseline. User feedback consistently highlights its superior intelligence, coherence, and unique ability to provide deep character insights. Through proper prompting, the model demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities and unprompted exploration of character inner thoughts and motivations.
    The model utilizes the custom Hydroblated-R1 base, created for stability and enhanced reasoning. The SCE merge method's settings are precisely tuned based on extensive community feedback (of over 10 diffrent models from Nevoria to Cu-Mai), ensuring optimal component integration while maintaining model coherence and reliability. This foundation establishes Electra-R1 as the benchmark upon which its variant models build and expand.

  description: |
    Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1 is a large language model (LLM) which is a derivative of Meta Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (AKA the reference model). It is a reasoning model that is post trained for reasoning, human chat preferences, and tasks, such as RAG and tool calling. The model supports a context length of 128K tokens.

    Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1 is a model which offers a great tradeoff between model accuracy and efficiency. Efficiency (throughput) directly translates to savings. Using a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach, we greatly reduce the model’s memory footprint, enabling larger workloads, as well as fitting the model on a single GPU at high workloads (H200). This NAS approach enables the selection of a desired point in the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff.

    The model underwent a multi-phase post-training process to enhance both its reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This includes a supervised fine-tuning stage for Math, Code, Reasoning, and Tool Calling as well as multiple reinforcement learning (RL) stages using REINFORCE (RLOO) and Online Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) algorithms for both chat and instruction-following. The final model checkpoint is obtained after merging the final SFT and Online RPO checkpoints. For more details on how the model was trained, please see this blog.

    My biggest merge yet, consisting of a total of 20 specially curated models. My methodology in approaching this was to create 5 highly specialized models:

    A completely uncensored base A very intelligent model based on UGI, Willingness and NatInt scores on the UGI Leaderboard A highly descriptive writing model, specializing in creative and natural prose A RP model specially merged with fine-tuned models that use a lot of RP datasets The secret ingredient: A completely unhinged, uncensored final model

    The Cogito LLMs are instruction tuned generative models (text in/text out). All models are released under an open license for commercial use.

        Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
        The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
        The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
            In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
        Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

    Dark coloration L3.3 merge, to be included in my merges. Can also be tried as a standalone to have a darker Llama Experience, but I didn't take the time.
    Edit : I took the time, and it meets its purpose.

        It's average on the basic metrics (smarts, perplexity), but it's not woke and unhinged indeed.
        The model is not abliterated, though. It has refusals on the usual point-blank questions.
        I will play with it more, because it has potential.

    My note : 3/5 as a standalone. 4/5 as a merge brick.

    Warning : this model can be brutal and vulgar, more than most of my previous merges.

    An experimental release.

    zerofata/GeneticLemonade-Unleashed qlora trained on a test dataset. Performance is improved from the original in my testing, but there are possibly (likely?) areas where the model will underperform which I am looking for feedback on.

    This is a creative model intended to excel at character driven RP / ERP. It has not been tested or trained on adventure stories or any large amounts of creative writing.

    Inspired to learn how to merge by the Nevoria series from SteelSkull.

    I wasn't planning to release any more models in this series, but I wasn't fully satisfied with Unleashed or the Final version. I happened upon the below when testing merges and found myself coming back to it, so decided to publish.
    Model Comparison

    Designed for RP and creative writing, all three models are focused around striking a balance between writing style, creativity and intelligence.

    it swears unprompted 10/10 model

    ... characters work well, groups work well, scenarios also work really well so great model overall

    This is pretty exciting though. GLM-4 already had me on the verge of deleting all of my other 32b and lower models. I got to test this more but I think this model at Q3m is the death blow lol

    Smart Nemotron 49b learned how to roleplay

    Even without thinking it rock solid at 4qm.

    Without thinking is like 40-70b level. With thinking is 100+b level

    This model would have been AGI if it were named properly with a name like "Bob". Alas, it was not.

    I think this model is nice. It follows prompts very well. I didn't really note any major issues or repetition

    Yeah this is good. I think its clearly smart enough, close to the other L3.3 70b models. It follows directions and formatting very well. I asked it to create the intro message, my first response was formatted differently, and it immediately followed my format on the second message. I also have max tokens at 2k cause I like the model to finish it's thought. But I started trimming the models responses when I felt the last bit was unnecessary and it started replying closer to that length. It's pretty much uncensored.

    Nemotron is my favorite model, and I think you fixed it!!

    RWKV (pronounced RwaKuv) is an RNN with GPT-level LLM performance, and can also be directly trained like a GPT transformer (parallelizable). We are at RWKV-7.
    So it's combining the best of RNN and transformer - great performance, fast inference, fast training, saves VRAM, "infinite" ctxlen, and free text embedding. Moreover it's 100% attention-free, and a Linux Foundation AI project.

    Granite 3.0 language models are a new set of lightweight state-of-the-art, open foundation models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage, including the potential to be run on constrained compute resources. All the models are publicly released under an Apache 2.0 license for both research and commercial use. The models' data curation and training procedure were designed for enterprise usage and customization in mind, with a process that evaluates datasets for governance, risk and compliance (GRC) criteria, in addition to IBM's standard data clearance process and document quality checks.
    Granite 3.0 includes 4 different models of varying sizes:
        Dense Models: 2B and 8B parameter models, trained on 12 trillion tokens in total.
        Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) Models: Sparse 1B and 3B MoE models, with 400M and 800M activated parameters respectively, trained on 10 trillion tokens in total.
    Accordingly, these options provide a range of models with different compute requirements to choose from, with appropriate trade-offs with their performance on downstream tasks. At each scale, we release a base model — checkpoints of models after pretraining, as well as instruct checkpoints — models finetuned for dialogue, instruction-following, helpfulness, and safety.

    A roleplay-centric finetune of IBM's Granite 3.0 3B-A800M. LoRA finetune trained locally, whereas the others were FFT; while this results in less uptake of training data, it should also mean less degradation in Granite's core abilities, making it potentially easier to use for general-purpose tasks.
    Disclaimer

    PLEASE do not expect godliness out of this, it's a model with 800 million active parameters. Expect something more akin to GPT-3 (the original, not GPT-3.5.) (Furthermore, this version is by a less experienced tuner; it's my first finetune that actually has decent-looking graphs, I don't really know what I'm doing yet!)

    We present FuseChat-3.0, a series of models crafted to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of multiple source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. To achieve this fusion, we utilized four powerful source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-It, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For the target LLMs, we employed three widely-used smaller models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-It, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct—along with two even more compact models—Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The implicit model fusion process involves a two-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mitigate distribution discrepancies between target and source LLMs, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for learning preferences from multiple source LLMs. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks related to general conversation, instruction following, mathematics, and coding. Notably, when Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served as the target LLM, our fusion approach achieved an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it showed significant improvements of 37.1 and 30.1 points on instruction-following test sets AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard respectively. We have released the FuseChat-3.0 models on Huggingface, stay tuned for the forthcoming dataset and code.

    Dolphin 3.0 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models. Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

    DeepHermes 3 Preview is the latest version of our flagship Hermes series of LLMs by Nous Research, and one of the first models in the world to unify Reasoning (long chains of thought that improve answer accuracy) and normal LLM response modes into one model. We have also improved LLM annotation, judgement, and function calling.

    DeepHermes 3 Preview is a hybrid reasoning model, and one of the first LLM models to unify both "intuitive", traditional mode responses and long chain of thought reasoning responses into a single model, toggled by a system prompt.

    Hermes 3, the predecessor of DeepHermes 3, is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2, including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.

    The ethos of the Hermes series of models is focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.

    This is a preview Hermes with early reasoning capabilities, distilled from R1 across a variety of tasks that benefit from reasoning and objectivity. Some quirks may be discovered! Please let us know any interesting findings or issues you discover!

    Impish_LLAMA_3B's naughty sister. Less wholesome, more edge. NOT better, but different.
    Superb Roleplay for a 3B size.
    Short length response (1-2 paragraphs, usually 1), CAI style.
    Naughty, and more evil that follows instructions well enough, and keeps good formatting.
    LOW refusals - Total freedom in RP, can do things other RP models won't, and I'll leave it at that. Low refusals in assistant tasks as well.
    VERY good at following the character card. Try the included characters if you're having sub optimal results.

    "With that naughty impish grin of hers, so damn sly it could have ensnared the devil himself, and that impish glare in her eyes, sharper than of a succubus fang, she chuckled impishly with such mischief that even the moon might’ve blushed. I needed no witch's hex to divine her nature—she was, without a doubt, a naughty little imp indeed." This model was trained on ~25M tokens, in 3 phases, the first and longest phase was an FFT to teach the model new stuff, and to confuse the shit out of it too, so it would be a little bit less inclined to use GPTisms.

  description: |
    I wanted to create a model with an exceptional capacity for using varied speech patterns and fresh role-play takes. The model had to have a unique personality, not on a surface level but on the inside, for real. Unfortunately, SFT alone just didn't cut it. And I had only 16GB of VRAM at the time. Oh, and I wanted it to be small enough to be viable for phones and to be able to give a fight to larger models while at it. If only there was a magical way to do it.

    Merges. Merges are quite unique. In the early days, they were considered "fake." Clearly, there's no such thing as merges. Where are the papers? No papers? Then it's clearly impossible. "Mathematically impossible." Simply preposterous. To mix layers and hope for a coherent output? What nonsense!

    And yet, they were real. Undi95 made some of the earliest merges I can remember, and the "LLAMA2 Era" was truly amazing and innovative thanks to them. Cool stuff like Tiefighter was being made, and eventually the time tested Midnight-Miqu-70B (v1.5 is my personal favorite).

    Merges are an interesting thing, as they affect LLMs in a way that is currently impossible to reproduce using SFT (or any 'SOTA' technique). One of the plagues we have today, while we have orders of magnitude smarter LLMs, is GPTisms and predictability. Merges can potentially 'solve' that. How? In short, if you physically tear neurons (passthrough brain surgery) while you somehow manage to keep the model coherent enough, and if you're lucky, it can even follows instructions- then magical stuff begins to happen.

    The Cogito LLMs are instruction tuned generative models (text in/text out). All models are released under an open license for commercial use.

    Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
    The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
    The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
        In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
    Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

    In August 2024, we released the first series of mathematical LLMs - Qwen2-Math - of our Qwen family. A month later, we have upgraded it and open-sourced Qwen2.5-Math series, including base models Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B, instruction-tuned models Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B-Instruct, and mathematical reward model Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B.

    Unlike Qwen2-Math series which only supports using Chain-of-Thught (CoT) to solve English math problems, Qwen2.5-Math series is expanded to support using both CoT and Tool-integrated Reasoning (TIR) to solve math problems in both Chinese and English. The Qwen2.5-Math series models have achieved significant performance improvements compared to the Qwen2-Math series models on the Chinese and English mathematics benchmarks with CoT.

    The base models of Qwen2-Math are initialized with Qwen2-1.5B/7B/72B, and then pretrained on a meticulously designed Mathematics-specific Corpus. This corpus contains large-scale high-quality mathematical web texts, books, codes, exam questions, and mathematical pre-training data synthesized by Qwen2.

    Replete-LLM-V2.5-Qwen-14b is a continues finetuned version of Qwen2.5-14B. I noticed recently that the Qwen team did not learn from my methods of continuous finetuning, the great benefits, and no downsides of it. So I took it upon myself to merge the instruct model with the base model myself using the Ties merge method

    This version of the model shows higher performance than the original instruct and base models.

    This model is an experimental version of our latest innovation: MGS. Its up to you to figure out what does it means, but its very explicit. We didn't applied our known UNA algorithm to the forward pass, but they are entirely compatible and operates in different parts of the neural network and in different ways, tho they both can be seen as a regularization technique.

    Updated tokenizer_config.json (from the base_model)
    Regenerated Quants (being uploaded)
    Re-submitted Leaderboard Evaluation, MATH & IFeval have relevant updates
    Aligned LICENSE with Qwen terms.

    MGS stands for... Many-Geeks-Searching... and thats it. Hint: 1+1 is 2, and 1+1 is not 3
    We still believe on 1-Epoch should be enough, so we just did 1 Epoch only.
    Dataset
    Used here the first decent (corpora & size) dataset on the hub: Magpie-Align/Magpie-Pro-300K-Filtered Kudos to the Magpie team to contribute with some decent stuff that I personally think is very good to ablate.
    It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:

    Q25-1.5B-Veo Lu is a tiny General-Purpose Creative model, made up of a merge of bespoke finetunes on Qwen 2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

    Inspired by the success of MN-12B-Mag Mell and MS-Meadowlark-22B, Veo Lu was trained on a healthy, balanced diet of of Internet fiction, roleplaying, adventuring, and reasoning/general knowledge.

    The components of Veo Lu are:

        Bard (pretrain, writing): Fujin (Cleaned/extended Rosier)
        Scribe (pretrain, roleplay): Creative Writing Multiturn
        Cartographer (pretrain, adventuring): SpringDragon
        Alchemist (SFT, science/reasoning): ScienceQA, MedquadQA, Orca Math Word Problems

    This model is capable of carrying on a scene without going completely off the rails. That being said, it only has 1.5B parameters. So please, for the love of God, manage your expectations. Since it's Qwen, use ChatML formatting. Turn the temperature down to ~0.7-0.8 and try a dash of rep-pen.

  description: |
    A continued pretrain of SuperNova-Medius on assorted short story data from the web. Supernova already had a nice prose, but diversifying it a bit definitely doesn't hurt. Also, finally a storywriter model with enough context for something more than a short story, that's also nice.

    It's a fair bit more temperamental than Gemma, but can be tamed with some sampling. Instruction following also stayed rather strong, so it works for both RP and storywriting, both in chat mode via back-and-forth co-writing and on raw completion.

    Overall, I'd say it successfully transfers the essence of what I liked about Gemma Sugarquill. I will also make a Qwen version of Aletheia, but with a brand new LoRA, based on a brand new RP dataset that's in the making right now.

    Model was trained by Auri.

    RPMax is a series of models that are trained on a diverse set of curated creative writing and RP datasets with a focus on variety and deduplication. This model is designed to be highly creative and non-repetitive by making sure no two entries in the dataset have repeated characters or situations, which makes sure the model does not latch on to a certain personality and be capable of understanding and acting appropriately to any characters or situations.
    Many RPMax users mentioned that these models does not feel like any other RP models, having a different writing style and generally doesn't feel in-bred.

    Model created by analyzing and selecting the optimal layers from other Qwen2.5-7B models based on their dimensional utilization efficiency, measured by the Normalized Effective Rank (NER). Computed like:
    Input: Weight matrix for each model layer
    Compute singular values σᵢ where σᵢ ≥ 0 # σᵢ represents the importance of each dimension
    Filter values above numerical threshold (>1e-12)
    Sum all singular values: S = Σσᵢ # S acts as normalization factor
    Create probability distribution: pᵢ = σᵢ/S # converts singular values to probabilities summing to 1
    Compute Shannon entropy: H = -Σ(pᵢ * log₂(pᵢ)) # measures information content
    Calculate maximum possible entropy: H_max = log₂(n)
    Final NER score = H/H_max # normalizes score to [0,1] range
    Results in value between 0 and 1 for each model layer

    This is still early stage. As always, feedback is welcome, and begone if you demand perfection.

    I do not really have anything planned for this model other than it being a generalist, and Roleplay Model? It was just something made and planned in minutes.
    Same with the 14 and 32B version.
    Kunou's the name of an OC I worked on for a couple of years, for a... fanfic. mmm...

    A kind-of successor to L3-70B-Euryale-v2.2 in all but name? I'm keeping Stheno/Euryale lineage to Llama series for now.
    I had a version made on top of Nemotron, a supposed Euryale 2.4 but that flopped hard, it was not my cup of tea.
    This version is basically a better, more cleaned up Dataset used on Euryale and Stheno.

  description: |
    We present FuseChat-3.0, a series of models crafted to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of multiple source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. To achieve this fusion, we utilized four powerful source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-It, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For the target LLMs, we employed three widely-used smaller models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-It, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct—along with two even more compact models—Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The implicit model fusion process involves a two-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mitigate distribution discrepancies between target and source LLMs, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for learning preferences from multiple source LLMs. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks related to general conversation, instruction following, mathematics, and coding. Notably, when Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served as the target LLM, our fusion approach achieved an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it showed significant improvements of 37.1 and 30.1 points on instruction-following test sets AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard respectively. We have released the FuseChat-3.0 models on Huggingface, stay tuned for the forthcoming dataset and code.

    RP/Story hybrid model, merge of Sugarquill and Neon. As with Gemma version, I wanted to preserve Sugarquill's creative spark, while making the model more steerable for RP. It proved to be more difficult this time, but I quite like the result regardless, even if the model is still somewhat temperamental.

    Should work for both RP and storywriting, either on raw completion or with back-and-forth cowriting in chat mode. Seems to be quite sensitive to low depth instructions and samplers.

    Thanks to Toasty and Fizz for testing and giving feedback

    Model was created by Auri.

    RP finetune of Supernova-Medius. Turned out surprisingly nice on it's own, I honestly made it only as a merge fuel, but it impressed me and Prodeus enough to release it separately (history repeats I guess, Sugarquill also started out this way). Quite interesting prose, definitely quite distinct from Supernova or EVA for that matter. Instruction following is decent as well. Not really much to say about this one, just a decent RP model, tbh. Euryale-inspired I guess.

    I started my experiment because of QwQ is a really nifty model, but it was giving me problems with xml output - which is what I use for my thought tokens. So, I thought... lets just merge it in!
    The first model worked pretty well, but I got a sense that the balances could be tweaked. Why not throw in some other models as well for fun and see if I can't run out of disk space in the process?

    There is a draft model to go with this one for speculative decoding and chain of thought reasoning: https://huggingface.co/nisten/qwen2.5-coder-7b-abliterated-128k-AWQ

    Using the above 4bit 7b in conjuction with the 36b is meant to setup a chain-of-thought reasoner, evaluator similar to what O1-O3 is probably doing. This way the 7b 4bit only uses up an extra 4-6Gb on the gpu, but greatly both speeds up speculative decoding AND also chain-of-throught evals.

  description: |
    This model is designed to improve the controllability and consistency of current roleplaying models. We developed a story flow thought chain approach that makes the system prompts combined with the entire user-BOT dialogue read like a first-person narrative told by the BOT. We found this design greatly enhances the model's consistency and expressiveness.

    Additionally, we allow users to play two roles simultaneously: one as the director of the entire plot (see Special Designs), and another as an actor dialoguing with the BOT. Users can be viewed as writers who need to draft outlines and plot summaries, while the BOT helps complete story details, requiring users to have powerful control over the BOT.

    The model's output is divided into two parts: the model's inner monologue (which it believes is invisible to users) and the final response.

    Overall, mirau features:

        Superior character consistency

        Powerful long-context memory capability

        Transparent thinking with hidden thought chains

  description: |
    Dolphin 3.0 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models. Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

    Dolphin 3.0 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models. Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

        LoRA Trained on ~1.1GB of literature and raw text over Qwen 2.5's base model.
        Cleaned text and literature as best as I could, still, may have had issues here and there.

    Freya-S2

        The first LoRA was applied over Qwen 2.5 Instruct, then I trained on top of that.
        Reduced LoRA rank because it's mainly instruct and other details I won't get into.

    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit.

    The models in this merge are some of my favorites and I found I liked all of them for different reasons. I believe this model is greater than the sum of its parts - it has the storywriting and language of Eva and Kunou, the spiciness of Magnum, and the uncensored intelligence of Tess. It excels in handling multiple characters and keeping their thoughts, speech, and actions separate, including scene changes. It also appears to match dialogue well to the characters and their backgrounds.

    Model_stock was the method used, it's very straightforward and quite fast, the bottleneck seemed to be my NVMe drive.

    All source models use ChatML prompt formatting and it responds very well. For testing purposes I am using a temperature of 1.08, rep pen of 0.03, and DRY with 0.6 (most Qwen models seem to need DRY). All other samplers are neutralized.

    Steiner is a series of reasoning models trained on synthetic data using reinforcement learning. These models can explore multiple reasoning paths in an autoregressive manner during inference and autonomously verify or backtrack when necessary, enabling a linear traversal of the implicit search tree.

    Steiner is a personal interest project by Yichao 'Peak' Ji, inspired by OpenAI o1. The ultimate goal is to reproduce o1 and validate the inference-time scaling curves. The Steiner-preview model is currently a work-in-progress. The reason for open-sourcing it is that I’ve found automated evaluation methods, primarily based on multiple-choice questions, struggle to fully reflect the progress of reasoning models. In fact, the assumption that "the correct answer is always among the options" doesn’t align well with real-world reasoning scenarios, as it encourages models to perform substitution-based validation rather than open-ended exploration. For this reason, I’ve chosen to open-source these intermediate results and, when time permits, to build in public. This approach allows me to share knowledge while also gathering more evaluations and feedback from real human users.

  description: |
    The LB Reranker has been trained to determine the relatedness of a given query to a piece of text, therefore allowing it to be used as a ranker or reranker in various retrieval-based tasks.

    This model is fine-tuned from a Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model checkpoint and was trained for roughly 5.5 hours using the 8 x L20 instance (ecs.gn8is-8x.32xlarge) on Alibaba Cloud.

    The training data for this model can be found at lightblue/reranker_continuous_filt_max7_train and the code for generating this data as well as running the training of the model can be found on our Github repo.

    Trained on data in over 95 languages, this model is applicable to a broad range of use cases.

    This model has three main benefits over comparable rerankers.

        It has shown slightly higher performance on evaluation benchmarks.
        It has been trained on more languages than any previous model.
        It is a simple Causal LM model trained to output a string between "1" and "7".

    This last point means that this model can be used natively with many widely available inference packages, including vLLM and LMDeploy. This in turns allows our reranker to benefit from improvements to inference as and when these packages release them.

    Update: We have also found that this model works pretty well as a code snippet reranker too (P@1 of 96%)! See our Colab for more details.

  description: |
    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit.
    I re-ran the original Chuluun formula including the newly released Ink from Allura-Org. I've found the addition gives the model a lot more variability, likely because of aggressive de-slop applied to its dataset. Sometimes this means a word choice will be strange and you'll want to manually edit when needed, but it means you'll see less ministrations sparkling with mischief.
    Because of this the best way to approach the model is to run multiple regens and choose the one you like, edit mercilessly, and continue. Like the original Chuluun this variant is very steerable for complex storywriting and RP. It's probably also a little spicier than v0.01 with both Magnum and whatever the heck Fizz threw into the data for Ink.
    I've also been hearing praise for a level of character intelligence not seen in other models, including Largestral finetunes and merges. I'm not about to say any model of mine is smarter because it was a dumb idea to use Tess as the base and it somehow worked.

    SmolLM2 is a family of compact language models available in three size: 135M, 360M, and 1.7B parameters. They are capable of solving a wide range of tasks while being lightweight enough to run on-device.

    The 1.7B variant demonstrates significant advances over its predecessor SmolLM1-1.7B, particularly in instruction following, knowledge, reasoning, and mathematics. It was trained on 11 trillion tokens using a diverse dataset combination: FineWeb-Edu, DCLM, The Stack, along with new mathematics and coding datasets that we curated and will release soon. We developed the instruct version through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a combination of public datasets and our own curated datasets. We then applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using UltraFeedback.

    Confucius-o1-14B is a o1-like reasoning model developed by the NetEase Youdao Team, it can be easily deployed on a single GPU without quantization. This model is based on the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model and adopts a two-stage learning strategy, enabling the lightweight 14B model to possess thinking abilities similar to those of o1. What sets it apart is that after generating the chain of thought, it can summarize a step-by-step problem-solving process from the chain of thought on its own. This can prevent users from getting bogged down in the complex chain of thought and allows them to easily obtain the correct problem-solving ideas and answers.

    An absolute unit derived from Qwen-72B, but turbo-charged with pure unfiltered boomer sigma grindset energy. This model has internalized decades of "back in my day" wisdom and distilled it into the most powerful financial NLP system ever created.

    Core features:

        Programmed to automatically respond "Just buy the dip" to any market analysis
        Enhanced pattern recognition for spotting "kids these days" scenarios
        Built-in mortgage calculator that always concludes "rent is throwing money away"
        Advanced NLP pipeline for transforming any input into "when I was your age" narratives
        Hardwired belief in "number go up" as the fundamental law of economics

    Training methodology: Collected prime boomer wisdom from countless Facebook rants, Thanksgiving dinner lectures, and unsolicited advice sessions. Fed it through Qwen's architecture until it achieved enlightenment and started spontaneously generating complaints about avocado toast.

    Performance metrics: Achieves SOTA results on:

        Real estate evangelism
        "Pull yourself up by your bootstraps" pep talks
        Gold standard nostalgia generation
        Market timing (but only in retrospect)

    Basically took the raw computational power of Qwen-72B and gave it a healthy dose of "they don't make 'em like they used to" energy. The result? A model that knows the secret to success is just working hard and investing in the S&P 500.

    Warning: May spontaneously generate advice about starting in the mail room and working your way up to CEO.

    R1 at home for RP, literally. Able to handle my cards with gimmicks and subtle tricks in them. With a good reasoning starter+prompt, I'm getting consistently-structured responses that have a good amount of variation across them still while rerolling. Char/scenario portrayal is good despite my focus on writing style, lorebooks are properly referenced at times. Slop doesn't seem to be too much of an issue with thinking enabled. Some user impersonation is rarely observed. Prose is refreshing if you take advantage of what I did (writing style fixation). I know I said Marigold would be my daily driver, but this one is that now, it's that good.

    Autonomous agents for software development are already contributing to a wide range of software development tasks. But up to this point, strong coding agents have relied on proprietary models, which means that even if you use an open-source agent like OpenHands, you are still reliant on API calls to an external service.

    Today, we are excited to introduce OpenHands LM, a new open coding model that:

        Is open and available on Hugging Face, so you can download it and run it locally
        Is a reasonable size, 32B, so it can be run locally on hardware such as a single 3090 GPU
        Achieves strong performance on software engineering tasks, including 37.2% resolve rate on SWE-Bench Verified

    Read below for more details and our future plans!
    What is OpenHands LM?

    OpenHands LM is built on the foundation of Qwen Coder 2.5 Instruct 32B, leveraging its powerful base capabilities for coding tasks. What sets OpenHands LM apart is our specialized fine-tuning process:

        We used training data generated by OpenHands itself on a diverse set of open-source repositories
        Specifically, we use an RL-based framework outlined in SWE-Gym, where we set up a training environment, generate training data using an existing agent, and then fine-tune the model on examples that were resolved successfully
        It features a 128K token context window, ideal for handling large codebases and long-horizon software engineering tasks

  description: |
    RpR (RolePlay with Reasoning) is a new series of models from ArliAI. This series builds directly upon the successful dataset curation methodology and training methods developed for the RPMax series.

    RpR models use the same curated, deduplicated RP and creative writing dataset used for RPMax, with a focus on variety to ensure high creativity and minimize cross-context repetition. Users familiar with RPMax will recognize the unique, non-repetitive writing style unlike other finetuned-for-RP models.

    With the release of QwQ as the first high performing open-source reasoning model that can be easily trained, it was clear that the available instruct and creative writing reasoning datasets contains only one response per example. This is type of single response dataset used for training reasoning models causes degraded output quality in long multi-turn chats. Which is why Arli AI decided to create a real RP model capable of long multi-turn chat with reasoning.

    In order to create RpR, we first had to actually create the reasoning RP dataset by re-processing our existing known-good RPMax dataset into a reasoning dataset. This was possible by using the base QwQ Instruct model itself to create the reasoning process for every turn in the RPMax dataset conversation examples, which is then further refined in order to make sure the reasoning is in-line with the actual response examples from the dataset.

    Another important thing to get right is to make sure the model is trained on examples that present reasoning blocks in the same way as it encounters it during inference. Which is, never seeing the reasoning blocks in it's context. In order to do this, the training run was completed using axolotl with manual template-free segments dataset in order to make sure that the model is never trained to see the reasoning block in the context. Just like how the model will be used during inference time.

    The result of training QwQ on this dataset with this method are consistently coherent and interesting outputs even in long multi-turn RP chats. This is as far as we know the first true correctly-trained reasoning model trained for RP and creative writing.

    Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
    The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
    The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
        In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
    Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

    LLMs have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks.

    Qwen2.5-1M is the long-context version of the Qwen2.5 series models, supporting a context length of up to 1M tokens. Compared to the Qwen2.5 128K version, Qwen2.5-1M demonstrates significantly improved performance in handling long-context tasks while maintaining its capability in short tasks.

    The model has the following features:

        Type: Causal Language Models
        Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
        Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
        Number of Parameters: 14.7B
        Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 13.1B
        Number of Layers: 48
        Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 40 for Q and 8 for KV
        Context Length: Full 1,010,000 tokens and generation 8192 tokens
            We recommend deploying with our custom vLLM, which introduces sparse attention and length extrapolation methods to ensure efficiency and accuracy for long-context tasks. For specific guidance, refer to this section.
            You can also use the previous framework that supports Qwen2.5 for inference, but accuracy degradation may occur for sequences exceeding 262,144 tokens.

    For more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, Technical Report, and Documentation.

    In the past five months since Qwen2-VL’s release, numerous developers have built new models on the Qwen2-VL vision-language models, providing us with valuable feedback. During this period, we focused on building more useful vision-language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5-VL.
    Key Enhancements:

        Understand things visually: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.

        Being agentic: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.

        Understanding long videos and capturing events: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.

        Capable of visual localization in different formats: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.

        Generating structured outputs: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.

    Model Architecture Updates:

        Dynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Training for Video Understanding:

    We extend dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension by adopting dynamic FPS sampling, enabling the model to comprehend videos at various sampling rates. Accordingly, we update mRoPE in the time dimension with IDs and absolute time alignment, enabling the model to learn temporal sequence and speed, and ultimately acquire the ability to pinpoint specific moments.

        Streamlined and Efficient Vision Encoder

    We enhance both training and inference speeds by strategically implementing window attention into the ViT. The ViT architecture is further optimized with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it with the structure of the Qwen2.5 LLM.

    The best RP/creative model from ArliAI yet again.

        Reduced repetitions and impersonation

        To add to the creativity and out of the box thinking of RpR v3, a more advanced filtering method was used in order to remove examples where the LLM repeated similar phrases or talked for the user. Any repetition or impersonation cases that happens will be due to how the base QwQ model was trained, and not because of the RpR dataset.

        Increased training sequence length

        The training sequence length was increased to 16K in order to help awareness and memory even on longer chats.

    RpR Series Overview: Building on RPMax with Reasoning

    RpR (RolePlay with Reasoning) is a new series of models from ArliAI. This series builds directly upon the successful dataset curation methodology and training methods developed for the RPMax series.

    RpR models use the same curated, deduplicated RP and creative writing dataset used for RPMax, with a focus on variety to ensure high creativity and minimize cross-context repetition. Users familiar with RPMax will recognize the unique, non-repetitive writing style unlike other finetuned-for-RP models.

    With the release of QwQ as the first high performing open-source reasoning model that can be easily trained, it was clear that the available instruct and creative writing reasoning datasets contains only one response per example. This is type of single response dataset used for training reasoning models causes degraded output quality in long multi-turn chats. Which is why Arli AI decided to create a real RP model capable of long multi-turn chat with reasoning.

    In order to create RpR, we first had to actually create the reasoning RP dataset by re-processing our existing known-good RPMax dataset into a reasoning dataset. This was possible by using the base QwQ Instruct model itself to create the reasoning process for every turn in the RPMax dataset conversation examples, which is then further refined in order to make sure the reasoning is in-line with the actual response examples from the dataset.

    Another important thing to get right is to make sure the model is trained on examples that present reasoning blocks in the same way as it encounters it during inference. Which is, never seeing the reasoning blocks in it's context. In order to do this, the training run was completed using axolotl with manual template-free segments dataset in order to make sure that the model is never trained to see the reasoning block in the context. Just like how the model will be used during inference time.

    The result of training QwQ on this dataset with this method are consistently coherent and interesting outputs even in long multi-turn RP chats. This is as far as we know the first true correctly-trained reasoning model trained for RP and creative writing.

    You can access the model at https://arliai.com and we also have a models ranking page at https://www.arliai.com/models-ranking

    A LLM model focused on security.
     Topics Covered:

    - Open Ports: Identifying open ports is crucial as they can be entry points for attackers. Common ports to check include HTTP (80, 443), FTP (21), SSH (22), and SMB (445).
    - Outdated Software or Services: Systems running outdated software or services are often vulnerable to exploits. This includes web servers, database servers, and any third-party software.
    - Default Credentials: Many systems and services are installed with default usernames and passwords, which are well-known and can be easily exploited.
    - Misconfigurations: Incorrectly configured services, permissions, and security settings can introduce vulnerabilities.
    - Injection Flaws: SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS) are common issues in web applications.
    - Unencrypted Services: Services that do not use encryption (like HTTP instead of HTTPS) can expose sensitive data.
    - Known Software Vulnerabilities: Checking for known vulnerabilities in software using databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or tools like Nessus or OpenVAS.
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): This is where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
    - Insecure Direct Object References: This occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input.
    - Security Misconfigurations in Web Servers/Applications: This includes issues like insecure HTTP headers or verbose error messages that reveal too much information.
    - Broken Authentication and Session Management: This can allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities.
    - Sensitive Data Exposure: Includes vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, health records, or personal information.
    - API Vulnerabilities: In modern web applications, APIs are often used and can have vulnerabilities like insecure endpoints or data leakage.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities: Identifying services that are vulnerable to DoS attacks, which can make the resource unavailable to legitimate users.
    - Buffer Overflows: Common in older software, these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to crash the system or execute arbitrary code.

    This is the standard Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model with grammar and function call enabled.

    When grammars are enabled in LocalAI, the LLM is forced to output valid tools constrained by BNF grammars. This can be useful for ensuring that the model outputs are valid and can be used in a production environment.

    Llama Guard 3 is a Llama-3.1-8B pretrained model, fine-tuned for content safety classification. Similar to previous versions, it can be used to classify content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM – it generates text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated.

    Llama Guard 3 was aligned to safeguard against the MLCommons standardized hazards taxonomy and designed to support Llama 3.1 capabilities. Specifically, it provides content moderation in 8 languages, and was optimized to support safety and security for search and code interpreter tool calls.

    This model is an advanced iteration of the powerful meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, specifically fine-tuned to enhance its capabilities in the legal domain. The fine-tuning process utilized a synthetically generated dataset derived from the French LegalKit, a comprehensive legal language resource.

    To create this specialized dataset, I used the NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO model in conjunction with Hugging Face's Inference Endpoint. This approach allowed for the generation of high-quality, synthetic data that incorporates Chain of Thought (CoT) and advanced reasoning in its responses.

    The resulting model combines the robust foundation of Llama-3.1-8B with tailored legal knowledge and enhanced reasoning capabilities. This makes it particularly well-suited for tasks requiring in-depth legal analysis, interpretation, and application of French legal concepts.

    We present the Llama-3.1-Storm-8B model that outperforms Meta AI's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B models significantly across diverse benchmarks as shown in the performance comparison plot in the next section. Our approach consists of three key steps:
    - Self-Curation: We applied two self-curation methods to select approximately 1 million high-quality examples from a pool of about 3 million open-source examples. Our curation criteria focused on educational value and difficulty level, using the same SLM for annotation instead of larger models (e.g. 70B, 405B).
    - Targeted fine-tuning: We performed Spectrum-based targeted fine-tuning over the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. The Spectrum method accelerates training by selectively targeting layer modules based on their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and freezing the remaining modules. In our work, 50% of layers are frozen.
    - Model Merging: We merged our fine-tuned model with the Llama-Spark model using SLERP method. The merging method produces a blended model with characteristics smoothly interpolated from both parent models, ensuring the resultant model captures the essence of both its parents. Llama-3.1-Storm-8B improves Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct across 10 diverse benchmarks. These benchmarks cover areas such as instruction-following, knowledge-driven QA, reasoning, truthful answer generation, and function calling.

    Llama 3.1 Swallow is a series of large language models (8B, 70B) that were built by continual pre-training on the Meta Llama 3.1 models. Llama 3.1 Swallow enhanced the Japanese language capabilities of the original Llama 3.1 while retaining the English language capabilities. We use approximately 200 billion tokens that were sampled from a large Japanese web corpus (Swallow Corpus Version 2), Japanese and English Wikipedia articles, and mathematical and coding contents, etc (see the Training Datasets section) for continual pre-training. The instruction-tuned models (Instruct) were built by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the synthetic data specially built for Japanese. See the Swallow Model Index section to find other model variants.

    A DPO-tuned Llama-3.1 to behave more "humanish", i.e., avoiding all the AI assistant slop. It also works for role-play (RP). To achieve this, the model was fine-tuned over a series of datasets:
        General conversations from Claude Opus, from Undi95/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Claude
        Undi95/Weyaxi-humanish-dpo-project-noemoji, to make the model react as a human, rejecting assistant-like or too neutral responses.
        ResplendentAI/NSFW_RP_Format_DPO, to steer the model towards using the *action* format in RP settings. Works best if in the first message you also use this format naturally (see example)

    Lumimaid 0.1 -> 0.2 is a HUGE step up dataset wise.

    As some people have told us our models are sloppy, Ikari decided to say fuck it and literally nuke all chats out with most slop.

    Our dataset stayed the same since day one, we added data over time, cleaned them, and repeat. After not releasing model for a while because we were never satisfied, we think it's time to come back!

    Here's the subjectively superior L3 version: L3-8B-Niitama-v1
    An experimental model using experimental methods.

    More detail on it:

    Tamamo and Niitama are made from the same data. Literally. The only thing that's changed is how theyre shuffled and formatted. Yet, I get wildly different results.

    Interesting, eh? Feels kinda not as good compared to the l3 version, but it's aight.

  description: |
    This model has went through a multi-stage finetuning process.

    - 1st, over a multi-turn Conversational-Instruct
    - 2nd, over a Creative Writing / Roleplay along with some Creative-based Instruct Datasets.
    - - Dataset consists of a mixture of Human and Claude Data.

    Prompting Format:

    - Use the L3 Instruct Formatting - Euryale 2.1 Preset Works Well
    - Temperature + min_p as per usual, I recommend 1.4 Temp + 0.2 min_p.
    - Has a different vibe to previous versions. Tinker around.

    Changes since previous Stheno Datasets:

    - Included Multi-turn Conversation-based Instruct Datasets to boost multi-turn coherency. # This is a separate set, not the ones made by Kalomaze and Nopm, that are used in Magnum. They're completely different data.
    - Replaced Single-Turn Instruct with Better Prompts and Answers by Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus.
    - Removed c2 Samples -> Underway of re-filtering and masking to use with custom prefills. TBD
    - Included 55% more Roleplaying Examples based of [Gryphe's](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gryphe/Sonnet3.5-Charcard-Roleplay) Charcard RP Sets. Further filtered and cleaned on.
    - Included 40% More Creative Writing Examples.
    - Included Datasets Targeting System Prompt Adherence.
    - Included Datasets targeting Reasoning / Spatial Awareness.
    - Filtered for the usual errors, slop and stuff at the end. Some may have slipped through, but I removed nearly all of it.

    Personal Opinions:

    - Llama3.1 was more disappointing, in the Instruct Tune? It felt overbaked, atleast. Likely due to the DPO being done after their SFT Stage.
    - Tuning on L3.1 base did not give good results, unlike when I tested with Nemo base. unfortunate.
    - Still though, I think I did an okay job. It does feel a bit more distinctive.
    - It took a lot of tinkering, like a LOT to wrangle this.

    This model is designed to be suitable for creative writing and roleplay, and to push the boundaries of what's possible with an 8B model. This RC is not a finished product, but your feedback will drive the creation of better models.

    This is a release candidate model. It has some known issues and probably some unknown ones too, because the purpose of these early releases is to seek feedback.

    Model has been further finetuned on a set of newly generated 50m high quality tokens related to Financial topics covering topics such as Economics, Fixed Income, Equities, Corporate Financing, Derivatives and Portfolio Management. Data was gathered from publicly available sources and went through several stages of curation into instruction data from the initial amount of 250m+ tokens. To aid in mitigating forgetting information from the original finetune, the data was mixed with instruction sets on the topics of Coding, General Knowledge, NLP and Conversational Dialogue.

    The model has shown to improve over a number of benchmarks over the original model, notably in Math and Economics. This model represents the first time a 8B model has been able to convincingly get a passing score on the CFA Level 1 exam, requiring a typical 300 hours of studying, indicating a significant improvement in Financial Knowledge.

    Welcome to the Tess-Reasoning-1 (Tess-R1) series of models. Tess-R1 is designed with test-time compute in mind, and has the capabilities to produce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning before producing the final output.

    The model is trained to first think step-by-step, and contemplate on its answers. It can also write alternatives after contemplating. Once all the steps have been thought through, it writes the final output.

        Step-by-step, Chain-of-Thought thinking process. Uses <thinking> </thinking> tags to indicate when the model is performing CoT.
        <contemplation> </contemplation> tags are used when the model contemplate on its answers.
        <alternatively> </alternatively> tags are used for alternate suggestions.
        Finally, <output> </output> tags are used for the final output

    Important Note:

    In a multi-turn conversation, only the contents between the <output> </output> tags (discarding the tags) should be carried forward. Otherwise the model will see out of distribution input data and will fail.

    The model was trained mostly with Chain-of-Thought reasoning data, including the XML tags. However, to generalize model generations, some single-turn and multi-turn data without XML tags were also included. Due to this, in some instances the model does not produce XML tags and does not fully utilize test-time compute capabilities. There is two ways to get around this:

        Include a try/catch statement in your inference script, and only pass on the contents between the <output> </output> tags if it's available.
        Use the <thinking> tag as the seed in the generation, and force the model to produce outputs with XML tags. i.e: f"{conversation}{user_input}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<thinking>"

    RPMax is a series of models that are trained on a diverse set of curated creative writing and RP datasets with a focus on variety and deduplication. This model is designed to be highly creative and non-repetitive by making sure no two entries in the dataset have repeated characters or situations, which makes sure the model does not latch on to a certain personality and be capable of understanding and acting appropriately to any characters or situations.
    Many RPMax users mentioned that these models does not feel like any other RP models, having a different writing style and generally doesn't feel in-bred.

    Slush is a two-stage model trained with high LoRA dropout, where stage 1 is a pretraining continuation on the base model, aimed at boosting the model's creativity and writing capabilities. This is then merged into the instruction tune model, and stage 2 is a fine tuning step on top of this to further enhance its roleplaying capabilities and/or to repair any damage caused in the stage 1 merge.
    This is an initial experiment done on the at-this-point-infamous Llama 3.1 8B model, in an attempt to retain its smartness while addressing its abysmal lack of imagination/creativity. As always, feedback is welcome, and begone if you demand perfection.
    The second stage, like the Sunfall series, follows the Silly Tavern preset, so ymmv in particular if you use some other tool and/or preset.

  description: |
    Significant revamping of the dataset metadata generation process, resulting in higher quality dataset overall. The "Diamond Law" experiment has been removed as it didn't seem to affect the model output enough to warrant set up complexity.
    Recommended starting point:
        Temperature: 1
        MinP: 0.05~0.1
        DRY: 0.8 1.75 2 0
    At early context, I recommend keeping XTC disabled. Once you hit higher context sizes (10k+), enabling XTC at 0.1 / 0.5 seems to significantly improve the output, but YMMV. If the output drones on and is uninspiring, XTC can be extremely effective.
    General heuristic:
        Lots of slop? Temperature is too low. Raise it, or enable XTC. For early context, temp bump is probably preferred.
        Is the model making mistakes about subtle or obvious details in the scene? Temperature is too high, OR XTC is enabled and/or XTC settings are too high. Lower temp and/or disable XTC.

    We are excited to announce the release of the Skywork o1 Open model series, developed by the Skywork team at Kunlun Inc. This groundbreaking release introduces a series of models that incorporate o1-like slow thinking and reasoning capabilities. The Skywork o1 Open model series includes three advanced models:

    Skywork o1 Open-Llama-3.1-8B: A robust chat model trained on Llama-3.1-8B, enhanced significantly with "o1-style" data to improve reasoning skills.

    Skywork o1 Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-1.5B: A specialized model designed to enhance reasoning capability through incremental process rewards, ideal for complex problem solving at a smaller scale.

    Skywork o1 Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-7B: Extends the capabilities of the 1.5B model by scaling up to handle more demanding reasoning tasks, pushing the boundaries of AI reasoning.

    Different from mere reproductions of the OpenAI o1 model, the Skywork o1 Open model series not only exhibits innate thinking, planning, and reflecting capabilities in its outputs, but also shows significant improvements in reasoning skills on standard benchmarks. This series represents a strategic advancement in AI capabilities, moving a previously weaker base model towards the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in reasoning tasks.

    This model was trained with new data and a new approach (compared to my other models). While it may be a bit more censored, it is expected to be significantly smarter. The data used is quite unique, and is also featuring long and complex markdown datasets.

    Regarding censorship: Whether uncensoring or enforcing strict censorship, the model tends to lose some of its intelligence. The use of toxic data was kept to a minimum with this model.

    Consequently, the model is likely to refuse some requests, this is easly avoidable with a basic system prompt, or assistant impersonation ("Sure thing!..."). Unlike many RP models, this one is designed to excel at general assistant tasks as well.

    We present FuseChat-3.0, a series of models crafted to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of multiple source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. To achieve this fusion, we utilized four powerful source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-It, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For the target LLMs, we employed three widely-used smaller models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-It, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct—along with two even more compact models—Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The implicit model fusion process involves a two-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mitigate distribution discrepancies between target and source LLMs, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for learning preferences from multiple source LLMs. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks related to general conversation, instruction following, mathematics, and coding. Notably, when Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served as the target LLM, our fusion approach achieved an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it showed significant improvements of 37.1 and 30.1 points on instruction-following test sets AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard respectively. We have released the FuseChat-3.0 models on Huggingface, stay tuned for the forthcoming dataset and code.

    Dolphin 3.0 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models. Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

    DeepSeek-R1 is our advanced first-generation reasoning model designed to enhance performance in reasoning tasks.
    Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1 addresses the challenges faced by R1-Zero, such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing.
    By incorporating cold-start data prior to the RL phase,DeepSeek-R1 significantly improves reasoning capabilities and achieves performance levels comparable to OpenAI-o1 across a variety of domains, including mathematics, coding, and complex reasoning tasks.

    Post-trained from Llama-3.1-8B across a wide range of evaluation tasks and scoring criteria, Selene Mini outperforms prior small models overall across 11 benchmarks covering three different types of tasks:

        Absolute scoring, e.g. "Evaluate the harmlessness of this response on a scale of 1-5"
        Classification, e.g. "Does this response address the user query? Answer Yes or No."
        Pairwise preference. e.g. "Which of the following responses is more logically consistent - A or B?"

    It is also the #1 8B generative model on RewardBench.

    DeepHermes 3 Preview is the latest version of our flagship Hermes series of LLMs by Nous Research, and one of the first models in the world to unify Reasoning (long chains of thought that improve answer accuracy) and normal LLM response modes into one model. We have also improved LLM annotation, judgement, and function calling.

    DeepHermes 3 Preview is one of the first LLM models to unify both "intuitive", traditional mode responses and long chain of thought reasoning responses into a single model, toggled by a system prompt.

    Hermes 3, the predecessor of DeepHermes 3, is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2, including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.

    The ethos of the Hermes series of models is focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.

    This is a preview Hermes with early reasoning capabilities, distilled from R1 across a variety of tasks that benefit from reasoning and objectivity. Some quirks may be discovered! Please let us know any interesting findings or issues you discover!

    This project aims to optimize model merging by integrating LLMs into evolutionary strategies in a novel way. Instead of using the CMA-ES approach, the goal is to improve model optimization by leveraging the search capabilities of LLMs to explore the parameter space more efficiently and adjust the search scope based on high-performing solutions.

    Currently, the project supports optimization only within the Parameter Space, but I plan to extend its functionality to enable merging and optimization in the Data Flow Space as well. This will further enhance model merging by optimizing the interaction between data flow and parameters.

    The Cogito LLMs are instruction tuned generative models (text in/text out). All models are released under an open license for commercial use.

    Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
    The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
    The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
        In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
    Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

    We introduce KernelLLM, a large language model based on Llama 3.1 Instruct, which has been trained specifically for the task of authoring GPU kernels using Triton. KernelLLM translates PyTorch modules into Triton kernels and was evaluated on KernelBench-Triton (see here). KernelLLM aims to democratize GPU programming by making kernel development more accessible and efficient.
    KernelLLM's vision is to meet the growing demand for high-performance GPU kernels by automating the generation of efficient Triton implementations. As workloads grow larger and more diverse accelerator architectures emerge, the need for tailored kernel solutions has increased significantly. Although a number of works exist, most of them are limited to test-time optimization, while others tune on solutions traced of KernelBench problems itself, thereby limiting the informativeness of the results towards out-of-distribution generalization. To the best of our knowledge KernelLLM is the first LLM finetuned on external (torch, triton) pairs, and we hope that making our model available can accelerate progress towards intelligent kernel authoring systems.
    KernelLLM Workflow for Triton Kernel Generation: Our approach uses KernelLLM to translate PyTorch code (green) into Triton kernel candidates. Input and output components are marked in bold. The generations are validated against unit tests, which run kernels with random inputs of known shapes. This workflow allows us to evaluate multiple generations (pass@k) by increasing the number of kernel candidate generations. The best kernel implementation is selected and returned (green output).
    The model was trained on approximately 25,000 paired examples of PyTorch modules and their equivalent Triton kernel implementations, and additional synthetically generated samples. Our approach combines filtered code from TheStack [Kocetkov et al. 2022] and synthetic examples generated through torch.compile() and additional prompting techniques. The filtered and compiled dataset is [KernelBook]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GPUMODE/KernelBook).
    We finetuned Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the created dataset using supervised instruction tuning and measured its ability to generate correct Triton kernels and corresponding calling code on KernelBench-Triton, our newly created variant of KernelBench [Ouyang et al. 2025] targeting Triton kernel generation. The torch code was used with a prompt template containing a format example as instruction during both training and evaluation. The model was trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a standard SFT recipe with hyperparameters selected by perplexity on a held-out subset of the training data. Training took circa 12 hours wall clock time on 16 GPUs (192 GPU hours), and we report the best checkpoint's validation results.

It is a reasoning model that is post trained for reasoning, human chat preferences, and tasks, such as RAG and tool calling.

    Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-4B-v1.1 is a model which offers a great tradeoff between model accuracy and efficiency. The model fits on a single RTX GPU and can be used locally. The model supports a context length of 128K.

    This model underwent a multi-phase post-training process to enhance both its reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This includes a supervised fine-tuning stage for Math, Code, Reasoning, and Tool Calling as well as multiple reinforcement learning (RL) stages using Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) algorithms for both chat and instruction-following. The final model checkpoint is obtained after merging the final SFT and RPO checkpoints

    DeepSeek-Coder-V2, an open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) code language model that achieves performance comparable to GPT4-Turbo in code-specific tasks. Specifically, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 is further pre-trained from DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Base with 6 trillion tokens sourced from a high-quality and multi-source corpus. Through this continued pre-training, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 substantially enhances the coding and mathematical reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Base, while maintaining comparable performance in general language tasks. Compared to DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 demonstrates significant advancements in various aspects of code-related tasks, as well as reasoning and general capabilities. Additionally, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 expands its support for programming languages from 86 to 338, while extending the context length from 16K to 128K.
    In standard benchmark evaluations, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 achieves superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT4-Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro in coding and math benchmarks. The list of supported programming languages can be found in the paper.

  description: |
    DeepSeek-R1 is our advanced first-generation reasoning model designed to enhance performance in reasoning tasks.
    Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1 addresses the challenges faced by R1-Zero, such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing.
    By incorporating cold-start data prior to the RL phase,DeepSeek-R1 significantly improves reasoning capabilities and achieves performance levels comparable to OpenAI-o1 across a variety of domains, including mathematics, coding, and complex reasoning tasks.

    Damascus-R1 builds upon some elements of the Nevoria foundation but represents a significant step forward with a completely custom-made DeepSeek R1 Distill base: Hydroblated-R1-V3. Constructed using the new SCE (Select, Calculate, and Erase) merge method, Damascus-R1 prioritizes stability, intelligence, and enhanced awareness.

    Technical Architecture
    Leveraging the SCE merge method and custom base, Damascus-R1 integrates newly added specialized components from multiple high-performance models:
        EVA and EURYALE foundations for creative expression and scene comprehension
        Cirrus and Hanami elements for enhanced reasoning capabilities
        Anubis components for detailed scene description
        Negative_LLAMA integration for balanced perspective and response

    Core Philosophy
    Damascus-R1 embodies the principle that AI models can be intelligent and be fun. This version specifically addresses recent community feedback and iterates on prior experiments, optimizing the balance between technical capability and natural conversation flow.

    Base Architecture
    At its core, Damascus-R1 utilizes the entirely custom Hydroblated-R1 base model, specifically engineered for stability, enhanced reasoning, and performance. The SCE merge method, with settings finely tuned based on community feedback from evaluations of Experiment-Model-Ver-A, L3.3-Exp-Nevoria-R1-70b-v0.1 and L3.3-Exp-Nevoria-70b-v0.1, enables precise and effective component integration while maintaining model coherence and reliability.

    We introduce our first-generation reasoning model, Tiny-R1-32B-Preview, which outperforms the 70B model Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B and nearly matches the full R1 model in math.

    We applied supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across three target domains—Mathematics, Code, and Science — using the 360-LLaMA-Factory training framework to produce three domain-specific models. We used questions from open-source data as seeds. Meanwhile, responses for mathematics, coding, and science tasks were generated by R1, creating specialized models for each domain. Building on this, we leveraged the Mergekit tool from the Arcee team to combine multiple models, creating Tiny-R1-32B-Preview, which demonstrates strong overall performance.

    This repository hosts model for the Open RS project, accompanying the paper Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What Doesn’t. The project explores enhancing reasoning capabilities in small large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) under resource-constrained conditions.

    We focus on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. By adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and leveraging a curated, compact mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to assess performance and behavior. Key findings include:

    Significant reasoning improvements, e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, outperforming o1-preview.
    Efficient training with just 7,000 samples at a cost of $42, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models.
    Challenges like optimization instability and length constraints with extended training.

    These results showcase RL-based fine-tuning as a cost-effective approach for small LLMs, making reasoning capabilities accessible in resource-limited settings. We open-source our code, models, and datasets to support further research.

  description: |
    We're thrilled to introduce AceReason-Nemotron-14B, a math and code reasoning model trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL), starting from the DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-14B. It delivers impressive results, achieving 78.6% on AIME 2024 (+8.9%), 67.4% on AIME 2025 (+17.4%), 61.1% on LiveCodeBench v5 (+8%), 54.9% on LiveCodeBench v6 (+7%), and 2024 on Codeforces (+543). We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first RL training on math-only prompts, then RL training on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks, but also code reasoning tasks. In addition, extended code-only RL further improves code benchmark performance while causing minimal degradation in math results. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

    FairyR1-14B-Preview, a highly efficient large-language-model (LLM) that matches or exceeds larger models on select tasks. Built atop the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B base, this model continues to utilize the 'distill-and-merge' pipeline from TinyR1-32B-Preview and Fairy-32B, combining task-focused fine-tuning with model-merging techniques—to deliver competitive performance with drastically reduced size and inference cost. This project was funded by NSFC, Grant 624B2005.

    As a member of the FairyR1 series, FairyR1-14B-Preview shares the same training data and process as FairyR1-32B. We strongly recommend using the FairyR1-32B, which achieves comparable performance in math and coding to deepseek-R1-671B with only 5% of the parameters. For more details, please view the page of FairyR1-32B.
    The FairyR1 model represents a further exploration of our earlier work TinyR1, retaining the core “Branch-Merge Distillation” approach while introducing refinements in data processing and model architecture.

    In this effort, we overhauled the distillation data pipeline: raw examples from datasets such as AIMO/NuminaMath-1.5 for mathematics and OpenThoughts-114k for code were first passed through multiple 'teacher' models to generate candidate answers. These candidates were then carefully selected, restructured, and refined, especially for the chain-of-thought(CoT). Subsequently, we applied multi-stage filtering—including automated correctness checks for math problems and length-based selection (2K–8K tokens for math samples, 4K–8K tokens for code samples). This yielded two focused training sets of roughly 6.6K math examples and 3.8K code examples.

    On the modeling side, rather than training three separate specialists as before, we limited our scope to just two domain experts (math and code), each trained independently under identical hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate and batch size) for about five epochs. We then fused these experts into a single 14B-parameter model using the AcreeFusion tool. By streamlining both the data distillation workflow and the specialist-model merging process, FairyR1 achieves task-competitive results with only a fraction of the parameters and computational cost of much larger models.

    The Tifa role-playing language model is a high-performance language model based on a self-developed 220B model distillation, with a new base model of qwen2-7B. The model has been converted to gguf format for running in the Ollama framework, providing excellent dialogue and text generation capabilities.

    The original model was trained on a large-scale industrial dataset and then fine-tuned with 400GB of novel data and 20GB of multi-round dialogue directive data to achieve good role-playing effects.

    The Tifa model is suitable for multi-round dialogue processing, role-playing and scenario simulation, EFX industrial knowledge integration, and high-quality literary creation.

    Note: The Tifa model is in Chinese and English, with 7.6% of the data in Chinese role-playing and 4.2% in English role-playing. The model has been trained with a mix of EFX industrial field parameters and question-answer dialogues generated from 220B model outputs since 2023. The recommended quantization method is f16, as it retains more detail and accuracy in the model's performance.

  description: |
    This model is a fine-tuned version of the powerful Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct, pushing the boundaries of natural language understanding and generation even further. My goal was to create a versatile and robust model that excels across a wide range of benchmarks and real-world applications.

    The post-training process is identical to the calme-2.1-qwen2-72b model; however, some parameters are different, and it was trained for a longer period.

    Use Cases

    This model is suitable for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

        Advanced question-answering systems
        Intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants
        Content generation and summarization
        Code generation and analysis
        Complex problem-solving and decision support

    Marco-o1 not only focuses on disciplines with standard answers, such as mathematics, physics, and coding—which are well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL)—but also places greater emphasis on open-ended resolutions. We aim to address the question: "Can the o1 model effectively generalize to broader domains where clear standards are absent and rewards are challenging to quantify?"
